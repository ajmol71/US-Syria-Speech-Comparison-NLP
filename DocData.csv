SYR_Doc1_Speech_Dom,"Gentlemen, the head of the government, presidents and the leaders of the youth organizations and the liberal unions, brothers and sisters, today I look at your faces, and I look at the faces of the sons of my country, they are full of sorrow and pain. I look at the eyes of the children of Syria. I don't see an innocent smile or innocent laugh. I don't also see playing, which puts smiles on their faces. I don't see toys. I hold on to the hands of the elderly, I find that the elderly are praying for their sons or for their daughters or for their grandchildren. We meet today, and the difficulties and sufferings are going on throughout the throughout Syria, there is no room for happiness in any corner of the nation. Security has become absent from the streets and alleys of the country we meet today, at the time where mothers have lost their children, their most beloved children, and families have also lost people who provide for them, and also children who have become orphans, brothers and sisters who have left one another as martyrs or refugees or missing people, and if all this pain is a black cloud over the country, this is not enough in order to compensate for the loss of the Beloved, or the retrieval of security and stability, or providing bread, water, medicine, fuel, throughout the country, because of the pain, we must also have the hope and from the depth of The sufferings we bring, we also see solutions the black cloud is preventing the sun from rising. However, we also have rain and hope, the hope that something will come about when rain falls. These feelings and this sympathy of pain and sorrow and challenge and determination, insistence is great energy, Syria will not come out of its crisis, except if this energy is transformed into a comprehensive national unit movement which saves a country from an attack which we have never remembered. We have never remembered such an attack throughout the history of this region, this national movement is the only way to seal the deep wounds which have harmed the social fabric and were about to rip our society apart, and it is only factor which is able to help Syria and to bring about society once again, and ethics in Syria to rise with Syria in all factors, every citizen is responsible and is able of giving something, even if it's something small or limited. In his view, the nation is for everyone. We all defend the nation. Everyone defends the nation in the way which he can with the means he possesses. The idea is defense. Understands his defense, and building his defense and also preserving the possessions and assets of the state. Is defense, the attacks on the nation, against all the nation, against all the people of the nation. Every person who is aware knows very clearly that the negative or waiting or waiting for others to solve the problem is against the country and will drive the country towards the abyss and not participating in the solutions. Meaning means going backwards, not going forwards, going towards reaching a solution and exiting the crisis. And because many people fell into the trap. Many people fell into the trap that the situation is a confrontation between the opposition and the authority. So they stood away and they. They are silent now we must turn once again and focus on the real situation today. The confrontation today is between the nation and its enemies, between the people and the murderous criminals, murderous killer, killers the people and their bread and their daily way of life, and those who deny all of this for the people, the situation of stability and security which we used to have, and the expansion or spread of terrorism and fear amongst the people, the killing of civilians and innocent takes away the blessings from our country. They killed the experts. They tried to call the intellectuals in order to expand or spread ignorance. They also attacked the infrastructure in order to increase the sufferings of our people. They prevented the children from going to their schools in order to destroy the future of the people and to express their ignorance. They also took away the electricity and the communications and the full and they left the elderly and the youth suffering under the cold of winter without medicine, without any medical assistance. This shows their brutality. We also shore their stealing. Saw how they stole the wealth and stole all the daily goods of the people so that the people would hunger. Is this a confrontation over power, or is it a confrontation between the nation and its enemies? Is it a confrontation over power, or is it revenge against the people who didn't give those terrorists and those killers the main say in order to divide Syria and divide our society, they are the enemy of the people, and the enemy of the people are the enemy of Allah, and the enemies of Allah will be in hell on judgment day. At the beginning, they wanted it to be an alleged revolution, but the people rose against them, and they prevented them. They denied them the social support, which they wanted to impose by the media and by the arms. And when they failed, they went to the next stage. And hence they took down, they took away their masks, and they showed the real weapons which they were using ever since the beginning, they used it hidden before then they showed it in public, and they began with their attempts to occupy cities. However, they also tried to occupy other cities. They struck with brutality, but the only thing or the more they struck, the more the people, with their vigilance and their perseverance was showing, discovered their real identity. So they decided to take revenge against the people wherever they may be, without any differentiation. They call it a revolution. However, it has nothing to do with revolutions from any way whatsoever. A revolution needs intellectuals. Revolutions are based on ideas. Where are the intellectuals? The thinkers? Who is the thinker of this revolution. Revolutions need leaders. Who knows the leader of this revolution. Revolutions are also based on education and thinking, not on ignorance. Revolutions are based on pushing the country forwards, not to take the country backwards centuries, to bless the country, not to deny electricity. Revolution is for the people. A revolution is not the revolution of those who come from outside so that they come to the country they are. It is a revolution for the interests of the people, not against the interests of the people. So please, is this a revolution? Are these people revolutionaries? They are a group of criminals. So behind all this, the takfiris extremists were working behind the lines by the bombing attacks and by the mass killings. They put the gangs in front, but they supported them from behind the extremists and the army and the people. They were one hand against the killers and rejected their killings. And as this continued, they approached, collapsed, the extremists. Then the extremists found another only way. They resorted to fighting in the back lines, and they used the procedure and practice of killings. And because the idea of extremism and tech theories is something new, they had to import it from outside, whether it be individuals or ideas. And here the equation changed, the terrorists and the takfiris who have the thinking of al Qaeda and call themselves jihadists. They came from everywhere they lead the terrorist operations on the ground and the armed figures or armed elements, they went to the back lines as people who assist in kidnappings and also sabotage. They are servants and humiliating spies working for the takfiris and the killers who don't speak any language. Accept the language of slaughtering and cutting up bodies. We, my dear brothers, we are fighting against these people, and a lot of them are not Syrians. They came because of false understandings, false slogans, which they call jihad. But this is very, very far away from jihad or Islam what they do. What is sure and certain is that what we are confronting, most of what we are confronting, are those terrorists who carry the thinking of al Qaeda. And I think that most of you know how this kind of terrorism was sponsored three decades ago in Afghanistan by the West and by Arab money. After their mission ended and the union USSR was dismantled, and they left in Afghanistan, they began to struck in everywhere. They struck the Arab world. They struck the Islamic world, and they also struck the West. They tried to get rid of them. In Afghanistan, I tried to get rid of them in different ways after the invasion of Iraq. However, this terrorism was stubborn, and it continued to spread, and it began to take its place inside the western societies themselves. So these events came in the Arab world, and especially in Syria, and this was an opportunity for these groups for the West, actually, for the West to take all of these terrorists, or the highest number possible of his terrorists, to take them to Syria, or send them to Syria to make Syra the land of jihad. And so hence they would get rid of two annoying enemies at the same time, get rid of a terrorist, and also at the same time weaken Syria, which is a nuisance, and which bothers the West. There is a organization which is related to terrorism. About one or two months ago, there was a report about the decrease of the terrorist operations in general, especially in East Asia and Central Asia. Yes, because most of the terrorists came to Syria from these countries, and some of them come from Western countries. We'd like to say these terrorists entering into any area and entering into Syria, this is something dangerous from the security perspective, and that's something normal. However, it's not impossible to put an end to them, to force them to leave when we have the courage and the will. However, what is more dangerous is the idea their ideals entering. And they're entering the society when such ideas and thinking enter into this society. Society becomes something which is full of harm. Society becomes altered and ugly, if you don't deal with this in all perspectives, we must rise above all our differences and divisions in this perspective. Otherwise, we will put our children and our grandchildren. We will put them in blood for generations and generations in the Syria which we know won't exist, not geographically, but the society which we knew before. However, this doesn't deny that such thinking leads to sedition and also destroys geography and destroys any meaning for any society or any state. So this is a big responsibility we must all unite in order to confront this. However, there are also other far reaching aspects related to the crisis, not only internal. Internally, it's very clear what they want. However, regionally, there are some who are trying to divide Syria, and there are others who are trying to weaken Syria. Some of them are providing the murderers with money and weapons, and some are providing them with support enemy countries based upon occupation and hostility, which we don't find this strange, and other neighboring countries are trying to weaken Syria, and practice Hajime against Syria and other countries are searching for a certain position in history. So they wrote it with the blood of the Syrian people and the Arab people. However, the Syrian people are stronger, and the Syrians promised them that they won't succeed. The info. Internationally, everybody knows that Syria was and will always be free sovereign, and will not accept bowing down and dictations. And this is what bothered the West, and is still bothering the West, and so they try to take it. Advantage of internal situation, to take Syria away from the regional political equation, to put an end to this annoying role, and to strike the idea of resistance and to transform us into people who follow their orders, similar to the situation elsewhere in other countries, however, the international community is not only the West, many of the countries of the world, first and foremost, Russia and China, together with the BRICS countries and many other countries, reject the meddling in the affairs of a country and destabilizing the region based upon their principles and their interests and their intent on the freedoms of the people in deciding their own fate. And so we express all our thanks to these countries. First and foremost, Russia and China and Iran and all of the countries which stood in support of Syria against any attempts to intervene in the internal affairs these countries won't see from the Syrian people except admiration, admiration, and we owe it to them, we recognize what they have done for us. The covid in light of all of this, in light of everything I said in this introduction, we cannot speak about a solution without taking into consideration these elements, the internal situation, the regional card, and also the international perspective. And any measure which won't take this into consideration won't be a real solution and won't have any effect whatsoever. Let's begin internally, the disagreement, although some people believe that it was between the those in power and opposition at the beginning, however, if some people believe that the confrontation was between opposition and the ruling party, such a disagreement in the modern world is about how to build the state, not how to destroy the state, is how to make progress and further develop the state, not to take the state backwards 10s of years, the relationship between the opposition and those in power is internal, internal however, when part of the internal opposition is politicized and related to the outside, then the confrontation becomes between the inside, the internal and the outside, between the independence of the nation and the hegemony on the of the nation, between remaining as sovereign and free and being occupied by foreign powers politically. And so hence, the situation is transformed into defending the nation as a whole, and everybody do not defend against the foreign assault, which is uses some internal tools. So when we say foreign or foreign opposition, we don't mean the place where these people live. We mean the place where their hearts are. Where are their hearts? Where are their minds? Who are they attached to? What they rely on, and most important of all, their financing. This is what we mean foreignly, whether they live inside Syria or outside. There are people outside Syria who live outside Syria, however, they are defending their country. Yes, gentlemen, it's not opposition against those in power, not an army against armed groups and killers only. Now we are up against a war with the full meaning of the word. We now are confronting a brutal foreign aggression, and such wars are more destructive and more dangerous than the conventional wars because they don't use tools to destroy us. They also use ourselves. Use Syrians to strike us. They use Syria and they use Syrians, and they try to take advantage of us in order to destroy our territories. And they try to do this by using Syrian hands themselves, and in such a war, we defend the country at the same time we do. We take up all the necessary reforms, reforms which are necessary for all of us. But this might not change the nature of the war, however, it will strengthen us, strengthen our unity, and further enhance our immunity against this war. Some people believe that these reforms will solve the problem. No, it is one factor, however, it will not serve. So reforms without security is like security without reforms, nothing can succeed. Not one can succeed without the other. This is what we said, and we still say, and those who said that Syria chose the security solution are not listening and not seeing we always said, time and again, that reforms and policy on the one hand and eliminating terrorism on the other hand. And those who try and turn around the truth, we say that when someone is subject to an assault. Or an attack, and they defend themselves. What do we say? We say they defended themselves, or they chose a security solution? No, we say that they defended themselves. So why, when the state defends the people and when the people defend the nation, why do they say that we chose a security solution? Defending the nation is a duty. It's nothing which is up for debate. Defending the nation is a legal, constitutional, legitimate duty, and it is the only choice. There is no other option, which is to defend, defend ourselves. So if we have chosen the security solution, and if we strive for this ever since the opening days, this doesn't mean that we don't defend them. Or, I repeat, actually, if we chose a political solution from the beginning, this doesn't mean that we don't defend ourselves. And if we chose a political solution from the very beginning, this means that we need a partner, a partner who is capable and who is willing to go ahead with a political process and to enter into a dialog process on the national level. And if we chose the political solution, and if we didn't see any partner, this doesn't mean that they don't want a political solution. It means that we haven't seen a partner over the previous period. More clearly, if someone wants to get married and looks for a partner and didn't find this partner, or hasn't found anyone who accepts Him as a partner. This doesn't mean that he doesn't want to get married. It means he hasn't found a partner. This is a situation we haven't found a partner. From the beginning, we have been speaking about the political solution. So any talk about the Syrian state choosing the security solution is not true. It was never raised any day. No official in the state said that we chose the security solution. We never rejected the political solution. We adopted this solution ever since day one, by dialog, and we extended our hand to all those who have a national political project which pushes Syria forward. However, with who do we hold dialog with people who have an extremist ideology, who don't believe except in the language of blood and killing and terrorism? Do we hold dialog with gangs which are given orders by the outside are part of the strangers and foreigners and their dictations, they tell them not to hold dialog because they know that dialog will prevent their plans from being fulfilled, their plans of weakening Syria and getting rid of Syria, especially some regional countries. And the officials in these regional countries believe that Syria exiting this crisis will put an end to their political future after they drowned and drowned their own people in lies and spending the resources of their countries to support terrorism, they can no longer justify their hostile policies on their involvement in bloodshed and killing civilians. Do we hold dialog with dummies which their roles were played or given to them by the West? Do we hold a dialog with those who did this, those who played such a role? Do we hold dialog with the slaves? No, we hold dialog with their masters. With respect to the West. The West is of colonialism, and it is the first and foremost power real practice of policy, of division. They are the ones which block the road to a dialog, because they have gotten used to giving giving dictations, and we have gotten used to independence and sovereignty and free decision making because the humiliated now have got used to this. We, we cannot, however, do this. And so those who speak about a political solution only are disregarding these facts. They are either ignorant of the facts, or they are betrayers who are trying to give the nation and the people over to the criminals and those who support them. They are selling their people and the blood of our people for free, and this is something which we won't allow. Some speak about the political solution only, and some speak about combating terrorism only. This is not precise. The solution must be comprehensive, which includes politics and also combating terrorism. And a third part, which is a social solution, nobody speaks about this social solution. We have some examples in Homs and that are specifically the situation has greatly improved because of the social situation. The social factor, people nationals, people who are nationalists, people who have ethics, have presented initiatives between the state and also between the armed elements and terrorists. And so this led to great results, important results. Actually, these people don't belong to any parties. They don't they don't have any political programs. They only have nationalist affiliation. Such initiatives are very important. So if we look at the solution in a comprehensive way. And we say that there are many parts combating terrorism, politics and social the social factor, especially because any crisis in any nation, if it's a normal crime, we must go back to the social roots always. So I'd like to salute those people who were able to make these national achievements according to their own abilities. I know some of them. I met some of them directly. Some others. I heard about them. However. They are unknown. Soldiers would like to salute them. We say that we rely very much on their initiatives. I After what I said, it seems that there was no one. Some people might think there was no one to hold dialog with, although what happened, we will hold dialog, and we will extend our hand always for dialog. We will hold dialog with all those who disagree with us in politics, those who were contradicted with us in their stances, without their stances being based upon harming the principles, principles of nationalism. We will hold dialog with political parties and individuals who didn't sell our country to strangers. We will hold dialog with those who laid down arms so that the Syrian Arab blood that will be in their veins will be real partners, real loyal partners, to every nationalist person who works for the interests of Syria, for the security and stability and independence of Syria. And so based upon this, and based upon our principles and norms like the sovereignty of the state and its independent decision making, and also the principles of the UN Charter and international law, all of his stresses on the sovereignties of the nations and their independence and their territorial integrity and the non intervention in their internal affairs. And because we believe in the necessity of dialog between the sons of Syria and the Syrian leadership, and for the sake of bringing that a secure atmosphere once again and restoring stability, the political solution in Syria will be as follows, the first stage, first of all, the countries, regional countries and international countries will be committed to stopping financing and arming and harboring the armed groups. At the same time, the armed groups must stop all the terrorist acts, and this will facilitate the Syrian refugees to come back to their real homes in a secure way. And after that, the military operations by the Syrian armed forces will stop the Syrian armed forces reserve the right to respond if the security of the state or the citizen or the public institutions or private institutions are subject to any attack. Number two, to find a mechanism that everybody will be committed to the previous element article, especially controlling borders. Number three, the current government will directly begin with comprehensive contacts with all of the members of Syrian society and community, all the different parties and associations, to hold open dialog sessions and to hold a dialog, national dialog conference, whereby all of those parties who want a solution in Syria, all of them can participate, whether they be parties inside Syria or outside Syria. The other stage, then, the following stage, is that the current government will call for a national dialog, comprehensive national dialog session, in order to reach a document which stipulates the territorial integrity and the rejection of terrorism and rejection of meddling in internal affairs. So the first part of the government of calling on the political parties is to decide the nature of this conference, or these dialog sessions, which will be held a national document which holds on to the territorial integrity and rejects terrorism and violence and intervention in our affairs. Such a document will draw the future. Such a charter will draw the future for Syria, the political horizon, the economy of Syria. And also there will be an agreement on new laws for political parties and elections and in. Total or local administration. Number two, this charter will be subject to referendum, a popular referendum. Number three, a comprehensive government will be formed whereby all components of Syrian society will will be represented, and it will take up the task of implementing the different articles of the charter. Number four, the constitution will be subject then to a referendum. After being adopted or ratified, the government will then go ahead with the laws which were agreed upon in the national dialog sessions in accordance with a new constitution, including an electoral law and so parliamentary new parliamentary elections will be held. Everything related to the Constitution and the laws, we can say if, if, if, in the dialog conference, laws are agreed to, or the Constitution is agreed to, then the government will go ahead and issue these laws. Then the third stage, first of all, a new government is formed in accordance with the Constitution, which will be formed at that time. Second of all, a general reconciliation conference will be held, and Amnesty will be issued to all those who were arrested because of the events. However, the rights of the civilians will be remain for them, then further rehabilitation of the infrastructure reconstruction and compensation for all those who suffered because of the events with respect to general amnesty, but at the same time providing the rights for their civilians, because the state has the right to give up its own rights. However, it cannot give amnesty when it comes to rights of civilians. However, I believe that if we reach this stage the amnesty must be a general amnesty, not from the nation, but those who own the rights. And then actually, we can reach the reconciliation, a stage of reconciliation when everybody forgives, when everyone forgives everyone, when each person forgives the other person. This is the main perspective for the political solution, as I said, these are only titles, and the government will look into the details, and the government will also lay down the details and further expand on these main items, and it will give a perspective and vision as a initiative. Over the next few days, an initiative will be presented, and all of these stages will be followed up in accordance with the different articles or segments I mentioned. However, let's speak about everything in its place. We are living in the era of fabrication. We are living in the era of false allegations, not us. However, this is a situation in general, false allegations in contradiction with what is happening really. So let's correct all of the ideas and all of the terms which are being raised. First of all, with respect to this vision, some people might express their fears. Some people might feel concerned. Some people might feel that this means we're going back when it comes to security perspective, I'd like to reassure everyone that with respect to combating terrorism, we will not stop. As long as even one terrorist remains what we began, we will not stop. So anything which we do in this initiative doesn't mean at all that we will take lightly the issue of combating terrorism. On the contrary, the more we go forward in combating terrorism, the more there is a possibility To achieve success with respect to fulfilling this vision."
SYR_Doc2_Speech_Dom,"IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO CORRESPOND TO SUCH GREAT FEELINGS I RECEIVED FROM YOU. OUR SOULS, OUR BLOOD WE SACRIFICE FOR YOU, BASHAR. YOU ARE THE GREATEST SON OF SYRIA, BASHAR AL ASSAD. TELL THE CRIMINALS TO KEEP TRYING. THEY CAN NEVER OVERCOME THE NATION OF SYRIA. MR. SPEAKER, OF THE ASSMEBLY, DEAR LEGISLATORS. I AM VERY HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AGAIN, UNDER THE DOME OF YOUR ASSEMBLY AND TO ADDRESS YOU ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE REGION AND SYRIA ARE GOING THROUGH, AND THROUGH YOU TO TALK TO THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF SYRIA, THE BELOVED SYRIA, THE ONE THAT BEATS WITH ONE HEART WITH LOVE AND DIGNITY. SYRIA, THE STRONG FORTRESS, THE GREAT WITH ITS HISTORY. SYRIA WITH ITS NATION. WITH THE PROMINENCE OF ITS PEOPLE IN EVERY PROVINCE AND EACH CITY AND EACH TOWN. I TALK TO YOU IN THESE PARTICULAR TIMES, CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH LOOK LIKE A TET OF UNITY TO US. IT IS A TEST THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE HAPPEN AGAIN FOR ALL, CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN OUR NATION. THE WILL OF GOD AND OUR WILL, WE WILL SUCCEED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO COME OUT OF THESE AS UNSCATHED AND STRONGER THAN BEFORE. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ARE ALWAYS THE PRIDE OF THIS NATION. YOU, THE GENEROUS, THE FORGIVER, IT YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR KINDNESS. THE FREE AND DIGNIFIED PEOPLE OF SYRIA ARE WITH YOU. THE PEOPLE ARE WITH YOU, AND GOD IS WITH US. WHOEVER BELONGS TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE ALWAYS HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGH. I AM TALKING TO YOU FROM THE HEART. WITH MIXED FEELINGS OF PRIDE TO BELONG TO THIS NATION WITH RECOGNITION AND GRATITUDE TO THE LOVE THAT YOU GIVE ME, AND THE SORROW AND SADNESS TO THE VICTIMS THAT PERISHED AMONG OUR SONS, THE SONS OF SYRIA. MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO KEEP THE SECURITY AND THE STABILITY OF THIS NATION, THIS REMAINS MY UTMOST GOAL AT THIS TIME. I KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTED THIS SPEECH SINCE LAST WEEK, AND I TOOK MY TIME TO TALK TO YOU UNTIL I GOT THE FULL PICTURE IN MY MIND OR AT LEAST SOME OF THE BASIC POINTS OF THE PICTURE. SO THAT THIS SPEECH DOESN'T COME AS A SENTIMENTAL RHETORIC THAT MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT AT THE TIME WHERE OUR ENEMIES ARE WORKING METHODICALLY TO BRING DOWN, TO DESTROY, TO DESTABILIZE OUR COUNTRY. OF COURSE, WE RECOGNIZE HOW SMART THEY ARE IN THE METHODS OF THEIR APPROACHES, BUT THEY WERE STUPID IN CHOOSING THE WRONG COUNTRY AND THE WRONG NATION. AND WE TELL THEM THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO KEEP LEARNING FROM THEIR FAILURES, BUT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE, WHICH IS TO KEEP LEARNING FROM THEIR SUCCESSES. IT IS NO SECRET WE ARE BROTHERS. ALL THE BIG CHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE REGION FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THERE ARE MAJOR CHANGES AND THAT WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE REGION WITHOUT EXCEPTION. ARAB COUNTRIES AND NON-ARAB COUNTRIES AND THIS ALSO MEANS SYRIA AMONG THESE COUNTRIES, BUT IF WE WANT TO LOOK TO WHAT CONCERNS US AND TO -- IN WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR, WE CAN SAY THAT WHAT HAPPENED COMFORTS THE SYRIAN POINT OF VIEW FROM AN IMPORTANT ANGLE WHAT HAPPENED IS AN EXPRESSION OF A POPULAR CONSENSUS. WHEN THERE IS SUCH A CONSENSUS, WE ARE HAPPY WHETHER WE AGREE OR DO NOT WITH ALL THE POINTS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THIS POPULAR -- THE POPULAR WILL OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED FOR THREE, FOUR DECADES, MAYBE MORE, NOW ARE BACK TO BE AT THE HEART OF THE EVENTS IN OUR REGION. THIS SITUATION IN THE ARAB COUNTRY, THEY HAVE TRIED TO DOMESTICATE IT, BUT THEY DID NOT SUCCEED. THESE WILL HAVE MANY EFFECTS. YOU REMEMBER ME IN MANY PREVIOUS SPEECHES, I ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE ARAB STREETS, ABOUT HOW THE ARAB STREET WAS THE REAL LEADER. MANY IN THE PRESS AND THE MEDIA AND COMMENTATORS THEY LAUGHED ABOUT IT. THE FOREIGNERS WHEN THEY MEET WITH US THEY SMILE WHEN I SAY THESE THINGS AND WHEN THEY WERE BRINGING TO US APPROACHES THAT WERE CONTRARY TO OUR INTERESTS, AND THERE WAS CONSPIRACIES AGAINST OUR FELLOW ARABS OR THE RESISTANCE, AND I USED TO TELL THEM EVEN IF I PERSONALLY ACCEPT IT, BUT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT. IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT, THEY WILL REJECT ME, AND, OF COURSE, THAT WAS A POLITICAL SUICIDE. THEY USED TO LAUGH, SAYING THAT THIS WAS NOT TRUE. NOW, I AM SAYING THE SAME THINGS, AND NOW THEY AGREE. AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS SINCE THE ARAB PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN DOMESTICATED, NOW THE CHANCES FOR US ARE EVEN BIGGER. IF THESE CHANGES CONTINUE TO MOVE AND TO EVOLVE IN THE DIRECTIONS THAT THE PEOPLES WANT THEM ANOTHER SIDE IS THE ORIENTATIONS OF THE ARAB STREET TOWARD THE MAJOR CAUSES OF THE ARAB PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE. I BELIEVE THAT THESE CHANGES WILL LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL -- IN THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM, MAJOR CHANGE FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES OR FROM A PATH OF SACRIFICE AND GIVEN INTO PRESSURE. SYRIA IS NOT AN ISOLATED COUNTRY FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ARAB COUNTRIES. WE ARE PART OF THE REGION, WE INTERACT AND WE ARE AFFECTED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT LAUGHING AT OTHER NATIONS, BUT HERE IN SYRIA WE HAVE SOME SPECIFICITIES. WE ARE DIFFERENT, DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. DOMESTICALLY OUR POLITICS -- OR POLICIES HAVE BEEN OPENED ON DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE NEGATIVE POINTS AND THE POSITIVE THINGS, AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED AND WHAT HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT AS GENERAL PRINCIPLES, THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR DOMESTIC POLICY. THE FOREIGN POLICY WAS BUILT ON STANDING FOR THE RIGHTS, NATIONAL RIGHTS, SOVEREIGNTY, AND SUPPORT OF RESISTANCE WHEN THERE IS AN OCCUPATION. THE LINK BETWEEN THESE TWO POLICIES IS THE SAME POINT, OUR COMPASS IS THE PEOPLE, WHEN WE DEVIATE FROM THE PEOPLE, WE DEEVE STATE FROM OUR GOALS. IN ANY CASE, THISESE TWO POLICIES OR THESE TWO PRINCIPLES CREATED A NATIONAL UNITY IN SYRIA THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED, AND THIS NATIONAL SITUATION IN SYRIA WAS THE REASON -- THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE NATION, OF SYRIA, AND THIS IS WHAT ALLOWED US TO DISMANTLE MANY MINES THAT WERE PLANTED IN THE PATH OF THE SYRIAN POLICIES AND POLITICS, AND WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE PIVOTAL POSITION OF SYRIA. THIS, OF COURSE, THE ENEMIES ARE UNHAPPY WITH THIS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY, AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IN THE TVs NOW ARESAYING THAT SYRIAN PRESIDENT CONSIDERS EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN SYRIA TO BE A CONSPIRACY. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE POINTS ONE AFTER THE OTHER, AND THEN WE DRAW THE LINKS. THE ROLE, OF COURSE -- THE ROLE OF SYRIA IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE ENEMIES, AND I WILL ALWAYS WARN THAT OUR SUCCESSES LEAD US TO BE COMPLACENT. I SAY THAT IN THE PAST YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR ENEMY, BUT AFTER THE BATTLE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE PREPARING OR PLOTTING, SO I SAID THAT AFTER EACH SUCCESS WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT SUCCESS, AND PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THE PLOTS FROM THE OUTSIDE. THERE'S NO SECRET THAT SYRIA IS UNDER A BIG CONSPIRACY. COUNTRIES THAT ARE FAR AWAY. OTHERS THAT ARE CLOSE BY, AND EVEN INSIDE. THEY ARE BASING THEIR ACTION ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY'RE SAYING REVOLUTION IN SYRIA. WE DON'T CALL IT REVOLUTION, OF COURSE, WHAT'S HAPPENING, BUT FOR THEM WHEN SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, THEY'RE SAYING REVOLUTION HAPPENING SOMEWHERE, IT'S ALSO HAPPENING REFORM THERE, REFORM HERE. LIBERTY SLOGANS, MEANS ALL THE SAME. THEREFORE, IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CALL FOR REFORM AND WE ALL ARE REFORMISTS, WE WILL WALK WITH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING REALLY. SO, THEY CREATED THIS AMALGAMATION BETWEEN THREE POINTS. I KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO US NOW AND YOU, REPRESENTATIVES, YOU KNOW THE DETAILS. BUT I WANT TO TAKE THE DETAILS TO UNIFY THE CONCEPTS WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE UP TO NOW. MAYBE THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT WILL COME LATER. THEY CREATED THIS MIXTURE WHEN DIVISION REFORM AND POPULAR NEEDS AND DAILY NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. YOU ARE REFORMISTS. MOST SYRIAN PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED, AND WE ALL CRITICIZE OURSELVES FOR NOT HAVING FULFILLED ALL THE NEEDS. BUT THE DIVISION OR THE FRAGMENTATION ENTERED, AND THEY STARRED HIDING UNDERNEATH THE OTHER TWO POINTS, SO I THINK MANY PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT TO THE STREETS WERE NOT -- WERE WELL INTENTIONED, NOT EVERYBODY THAT CAME OUT TO THE STREET WAS ILL INTENTIONED. THE CONSPIRATORS ARE ALWAYS A MINORITY. THIS IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH. EVEN US AS A GOVERNMENT, WE DIDN'T KNOW. WE WERE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNTIL THE SABOTAGE STARTED AND THE ATTACKS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION. WHAT IS THE RISK BETWEEN REFORM AND THE KILLING AND REFORM AND DESTRUCTION TO A POINT WHERE SOME OF THE SATELLITE CHANNELS, THEY ALWAYS ACCUSE US OF BEING -- USING CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THEY WERE -- THERE WERE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF ATTACKS AGAINST INSTITUTIONS A FULL HOUR BEFORE THEY HAPPENED. HOW DID THEY KNOW? WHEN THESE THINGS STARTED, IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR US TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO MISUNDERSTAND THE WAY WE WERE GOING TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS WHEN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE UNCOVERED WHAT WAS HAPPENING, AND THE REACTION CAME AS YOU NOTICED THROUGH THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, NOT THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT STEPPED BACK A LITTLE BIT, AND WE ALLOWED THE PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH IT AND TO PROTECT THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND THE NATIONAL UNITY CAME BACK TO SYRIA. SO, WHAT WE SAY NOW IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW. IS IT THE FIRST STEP? IS IT AN ADVANCED STEP? BUT WHAT WE CARE ABOUT IS THE LAST STEP. THE LAST ONE IS THAT SYRIA BECOME FRAGMENTED, THAT SYRIA FALLS DOWN, AND THAT THE LAST OBSTRUCTION -- OR THE LAST OBSTACLE TOWARD THE ISRAELI PLAN IS REMOVED. THEY WILL KEEP REPEATING. THEY WILL KEEP TRYING. AND EVERY TIME THEY FAIL, THEY WILL START -- THEY WILL COME AGAIN IN ANOTHER WAY, SO WE HAVE TO EXPECT MORE ATTEMPTS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE ADVISED ME NOT TO TALK ABOUT DETAILS AND STAY IN GENERAL, BUT IT IS -- AS YOU KNOW ME, IT IS MY HABIT, MY CUSTOM, TO TALK ABOUT DETAILS. THEY STARTED WITH INCITES MANY WEEKS BEFORE. THEY STARTED WITH INCITEMENT IN THE INTERNET AND SATELLITE TVs.THEY DID NOT ACHIEVE ANYTHING. THEN THEY MOVED TOWARD DIVISION, AND THEY FABRICATED, FORGED, IMAGES. THEY FORGED INFORMATION. THEN THEY STARTED WITH THE SECTARIAN LINE. ALSO INCITEMENT. THEY WERE SENDING SMS MESSAGES, TELLING ONE SECT BE CAREFUL, THE OTHER SECT IS GOING TO ATTACK THEM, TO ATTACK YOU. AND THEN THEY SENT PEOPLE, MASS PEOPLE, KNOCKING ON DOORS AND SAYING MAKE SURE TO GO OCCUPY THE STREET BECAUSE THE OTHER SECTS ARE OCCUPYING THE STREET. THEY DID THIS, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO THWART THIS. THEY STARTED SHOOTING PEOPLE INDISCRIMINATELY SO THAT -- TO CREATE MORE ANGER. SO, WE DID NOT DISMANTLE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE, BUT IT IS AN ORGANIZED STRUCTURE. THERE ARE PEOPLE ACROSS THE PROVINCES. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ACTORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE EYEWITNESSS WHO ARE ALSO PART OF THE PLOT. THEY TRIED -- STARTED WITH THE PROVINCE OF SYRIA, SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S A BORDER REGION, AND I TELL THEM IF DERAA IS A BORDER REGION, IT IS IN THE HEART OF EVERY SYRIAN. BUT IF DERAA IS NOT IN THE HEARTLAND OF SYRIA, IT IS IN THE HEART OF ALL SYRIA AND ALL SYRIANS. THIS IS ITS HISTORY, AND THIS IS ITS PRESENT, DERAA IS A FIRST CLASS, FIRST-LINE PROVINCE. THE FIRST LINE PROTECTS THE OTHER LINES. THEY PROTECT NATURE. OF COURSE, THEY CANNOT AT THE SAME TIME CONSPIRE AGAINST THE NATION. THIS IS, OF COURSE, NOT TRUE. THEREFORE, THE PEOPLE OF DERAA ARE NOT AT ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THWART THE CONSPIRACY. WE ARE WITH YOU, SIR. AND WE ARE ALWAYS DERAA, ALL SYRIAN PEOPLE ARE WITH THE PEOPLE OF DERAA. Translator: SYRIA AND ALL ITS MARTYRS AND ITS MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ALL WITH YOU, AND THEY ALL TELL YOU, WE ARE WITH YOU. WE SUPPORT YOU. GO AHEAD, LEAD US. LEAD US. Translator: THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA ARE THE PEOPLE OF TRUE PATRIOTISM AND TRUE ARABISM. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE OF DIGNITY AND HONOR, AND THEY WILL CONTAIN THE MINORITY THAT WANTED TO BRING IN CONFLICT AND FRAGMENTATION TO OUR NATIONAL UNITY. IN ANY CASE, THEY TRANSFERRED THE PLAN TO OTHER PROVINCES AND WENT TO OTHER TOWNS, THE SAME MECHANISM, INCITEMENT AND KILLING AND DESTRUCTION, AND THERE WERE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE FORCES NOT TO HURT ANY CITIZEN. BUT, OF COURSE, WHEN THINGS GO TO THE STREETS, CHAOS HAPPENS, AND THE REACTION BECOMES -- BECOME THE PREVAILING THING. AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED, ACCIDENTS HAPPENED IN THE STREETS. THERE WERE VICTIMS. IN MANY CASE THE BLOOD THAT WAS SHED WAS SYRIAN BLOOD. WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT THIS POINT. THE VICTIMS ARE OUR BROTHERS, AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE OUR FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE REASONS AND THOSE BEHIND IT AND INVESTIGATE AND BRING TO JUSTICE. IF WE HAD THIS INJURY, WE HAVE TO INVEST IT TOWARD REINFORCING THE UNITY, TO THWART THE FRAGMENTATION AND TO KEEP LOVE FRAGMENTATION AND TO KEEP LOVE PREVAILING FEELING BETWEEN ALL THE SONS OF SYRIA. WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN 2005, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL WAR. THEY WANT US TO GIVE THEM A STATEMENT OF SUBMISSION. WHAT HAPPENED THEN, IT LOOKED LIKE WE HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SUBMISSION CHECK. THE SAME PRINCIPLE. NOW THERE IS A VIRTUAL DEFEAT PLAN FOR SYRIA. THERE IS CHAOS IN THE COUNTRY. AND THE SLOGAN OF REFORM, THIS CHAOS, AND THE TITLE OF REFORM, THEN THE SECTS WILL CLASH AND DEFEAT OF SYRIA WILL PLACE. WE IS PLAN IN 2005 THROUGH POPULAR AWARENESS. TODAY, IT IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEIR TECHNIQUES ARE BETTER, BUT THE POPULAR ONE IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS TIME AROUND WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO REACT VERY QUICKLY. BUT WE CANNOT BE COMPLACENT. WE HAVE TO REINFORCE THE NATIONAL POPULAR AWARENESS BECAUSE THAT IS THE REAL PROTECTION, THE SHIELD OF THE SYRIAN NATION. THERE IS A MAJOR POINT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE REGION. WE TALK ABOUT WAYS. IS THIS WAVE CARRYING US OR ARE WE CARRYING IT. IF THIS WAVE COMES TO SYRIA, WE HAVE TO DETERMINE IF IT COMES IF IT IS AN ENERGY. IF IT COMES, THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANNELLED FOR THE GOOD FOR US, NOT THE OTHER WAY. WHAT WE ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT INCREASING THE SALARIES, ET CETERA, AND THE POLITICAL PARTY, LAWS, ET CETERA, AND THE EMERGENCY LAW, I AM NOT ADDING ANYTHING KNEW, BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE THINK. AND WHEN YOU DO, THEN WE ARE LIVING IN HARMONY AND COMMUNICATE IN HARMONY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW THE GOVERNMENT THINKS. SOMETIMES WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF COMMUNICATION. WE'RE NOT GOOD AT MARKING THE GOOD IDEAS OR INTENTIONS THAT WE HAVE. SOMETIMES WHAT WE DO AND SAY IS MISINTERPRETED. THESE REFORMS, ARE WE OPTING FOR THESE REFORMS BECAUSE THERE IS A PROBLEM, BECAUSE THERE IS A CRISIS? IF THE QUESTION IS YES, THEN THIS GOVERNMENT IS AN OPPORTUNIST STATE, AND THIS IS NOT GOOD. MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE SO PROUD THAT YOU ARE LEADING US TOWARDS FURTHER VICTORY. BUT IF WE SAID THAT THESE REFORMS ARE TAKING PLACE UNDER PRESSURE, POPULAR PRESSURE, THIS IS WEAKNESS. I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING PRESSURES AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRY MEANS THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS GOING TO YIELD TO THOSE PRESSURES FROM THE OUTSIDE. SO REFORMS ARE NOT BUILT ON PRESSURE, THEY ARE BUILT ON POPULAR NEEDS, SOCIAL NEEDS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO RESPOND TO AND FULFILL. THESE ARE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS. THE NEEDS ARE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS. SO IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO GLADLY FULFILL. IF THEY CAN'T, THEN I WANTED TO CORRECT THIS. PRESSURE THE LEADER COMES UNDER IS THE TRUST PEOPLE PUT IN THEM. THE PRESSURE IS THE FUNCTION OF THE LEADER, AND THE PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE OF THE AWARENESS OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SURPRISED US AS THEY DID EVERY TIME. THIS MAKES US THINK HOW TO GRATEFUL TO THIS TRUST AND THIS QUALITY OF THIS NATION. THE MARKERS OF LATAKIA SAY OUR BLOOD WAS SHED FOR YOU. SO WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY WERE NOT DECISIONS. DECISIONS ARE NOT MADE TWICE, THEY ARE MADE ONCE. AND THOSE ARE DECISIONS WE MADE IN 2005. WHY DID WE TALK ABOUT THEM LAST THURSDAY? FOR TWO REASONS. ONE IS ABOUT THE CRISIS, AND ANOTHER -- THE FIRST ONE IS NOT RELATED TO THE CRISIS, IT IS DUE TO OUR NEED FOR REFORM. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN 2005, THERE WERE NO PRESSURES. IN 2004, TO THE TUNIS SUMMIT, IT WAS THE FIRST AFTER INVASION OF IRAQ. THERE WAS A TOTAL COLLAPSE, SURRENDER TO THE AMERICANS, AND THERE WERE PARTIES THAT WERE -- THE AMERICANS WERE TRYING TO IMPOSE REFORMS ON US, AND WE FOUGHT VERY ADAMANTLY AGAINST THESE IN THE SUMMIT IN TUNIS AND BROUGHT IT DOWN, THE SAME AS THE COUNTRY IN 2005, WE SUGGESTED THESE REFORMS FOR OUR OWN COUNTRY, OUR DEMOCRACY, DMOKITIZATION, AND THESE ARE PRESSURES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IRAQ, WITH RESISTANCE AND OTHER, THESE WERE THE REASONS BEHIND THE PRESSURE THAT THE SYRIA CAME UNDER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LINK BETWEEN THE CRISIS AND REFORM, WHEN WE SAID DO YOU WANT REFORM, OKAY. WE WERE LATE. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT REALLY. THOSE THAT WANT REFORM, YOU'RE RIGHT, WE ARE GOING TOWARDS REFORM. THOSE WHO WANT SOMETHING ELSE, OF COURSE, YOU ARE GOING TO BE ISOLATED. I THINK THAT POPULAR AWARENESS WAS GOOD AND WAS ENOUGH TO STOP IT, BUT WHY WE AS A STATE, WE ALSO NEED TO BE PART OF THIS AND BE PROACTIVE. THE FRAGMENTATION IS FELT THROUGH AWARENESS. THE REFORM OF COURSE IS SOMETHING THAT IS A PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME. THE GOVERNMENT, THE STATE HAS PROMISED REFORM, DID NOT FULFILL, AND TO UNDERSTAND THIS, LET ME QUICKLY GO OVER THE REFORM PASSED SINCE THE YEAR 2000. I CAME TO THIS SAME ASSEMBLY IN 2000 IN MY OATH SPEECH, AND I TALKED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE MIND OF THE SYRIANS AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT IT WAS JUST WITH THE TITLE AND HEADLINES, IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT KIND OF REFORM THAT APPEARED IN 2005. THEN AFTER THAT SPEECH, THE PRESSURE STARTED, THEN THE SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS IN NEW YORK, THE PRESSURE THAT THE ARABS AND MUSLIMS THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER THAT. THE INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN, THE INVASION OF IRAQ, THEN THE PRESSURE ON SYRIA TO STAND WITH THE OCCUPATION. FOUR YEARS OF DROUGHT THAT REALLY HURT THE ECONOMY OF SYRIA. WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT PERIOD WAS THE CHANGE OR SHIFT IN PRIORITIES. WE -- I TALKED MANY TIMES IN INTERVIEWS AND MAYBE IN FOREIGN PRESS, AND I SAID THAT WHAT WE WENT THROUGH PUSHED US, WHAT HAPPENED PUSHED US TO CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES. WE HAVE TO SEPARATE BETWEEN WHAT IS OBJECTIVE AND WHAT IS NOT. WHEN I SAY THERE IS A DROUGHT, THAT IS BEYOND MY POWER. IT IS NOT IN MY HANDS. DOES NOT MEAN THERE ARE NO OTHER THINGS THAT CAN HELP MY ECONOMY. I KNOW THAT GENERATIONS ARE COMING AROUND. THOSE WHO WERE TEN IN 2000 ARE NOW 20. WHAT MATTERS IS STABILITY OF SYRIA. AND WE ARE LIVING STABILITY. WHAT IS AS IMPORTANT IS THE LIVELIHOOD OF PEOPLE. I MEET WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. 99% OF WHAT I TALK ABOUT IS ABOUT LIVELIHOOD OF PEOPLE. THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS, WILL YOU LIVELIHOOD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, BUT THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE LATENESS IN OTHER REFORMS, EMERGENCY LAW, POLITICAL PARTIES LAW, ET CETERA. THE PROBLEM IS WE CAN POSTPONE A STATEMENT BY A POLITICAL PARTY, WE CAN POSTPONE IT BY MONTHS AND YEARS, BUT WE CANNOT POSTPONE FEEDING A CHILD IN THE MORNING. [ APPLAUSE ] WE CAN POSTPONE SOME KIND OF SUFFERING, EMERGENCY LAWS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER, BUT WE CANNOT POSTPONE PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO A CHILD, AND OF COURSE YOU ALL FACE THESE HARDSHIPS. SO THIS IS A MATTER OF PRIORITIES. BUT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT US AT LEAST IN 2009 AND 2010, SITUATION WAS BETTER. WE WERE ABLE OR WE COULD HAVE DID THAT. BUT TO BE FRANK, THE POLITICAL PARTY LAW IS PRESENT, IS UNDER STUDY, AND THE EMERGENCY LAW OF WARSAW IS THERE AS A DRAFT, BUT WE HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THAT. WE CANNOT SAY THEY DID NOT DO THEIR JOB, THEY DID. OF COURSE, WE WERE LATE IN IMPLEMENTING, BUT LED TO THIS EVALUATION. THESE REFORMS, THESE REFORMS ARE NOT NEW. THE REFORM IS PROBABLY LACK OF MAYBE IT'S BUREAUCRACY, WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND WE KNOW HOW WE WORK, BUT I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE. THE REFORM, OF COURSE, IS POSITIVE. BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS THE CONTENT OF SUCH REFORM. WHAT WE WERE PLANNING, THERE IS A NEW PARLIAMENT AFTER THE ELECTIONS. THERE IS A NEW ADMINISTRATION. THERE IS A NEW GOVERNMENT. IT WAS PLANNED SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT RESIGNS. SO WE WERE SAYING THAT 2011 WE WILL HAVE NEW BLOOD INTO THE GOVERNMENT, AND WE MOVE TO A NEW STEP, AND THEN WE HAD THE REGIONAL CONGRESS, AND YOU SAY HOW DID YOU TAKE DECISIONS IN THE 10th CONGRESS AND THE 11thCONGRESS, YOU STILL HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THEM. OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO. NOW, WHAT I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS WAVE, I WANT TO SAY THAT THE REFORM IS NOT A SEASONAL THING. SO IT IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF THE WAVE THAT THE REGION IS GOING THROUGH. IT IS OF COURSE MEANINGLESS. I TOLD ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"" WHEN THINGS STARTED HAPPENING IN EGYPT AND I WAS ASKED ABOUT REFORM IN SYRIA, AND THEY ASKED ME ARE YOU READY TO DO REFORM, AND I SAID IF YOU HAVE NOT STARTED REFORMS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE LATE. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS PLAN BEFORE, THEN IT IS LATE. THE QUESTION IS, WE HAD THIS PLAN FROM BEFORE. AND AS YOU KNOW ME, I AM ALWAYS FRANK WITH YOU. MANY FOREIGNERS ASK ME, THEY WANT TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A REFORMIST AND THOSE AROUND HIM ARE PREVENTING HIM, AND I SAID NO, THIS IS NOT TRUE. IN FACT, THEY ARE PUSHING ME. THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES, THERE IS DELAY. BUT THERE ARE -- NO ONE IS AGAINST. THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST ARE A MINORITY OF CORRUPT PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THEM BY NAME. BUT THERE ARE NO REAL OBSTRUCTIONS OR OBSTACLES. THE CHALLENGE IS WHAT KIND OF REFORM WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM SUBMITTING REFORM TO THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH MIGHT BE JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL. REFORM NEEDS TO BE PLANNED ON TEN YEARS IN THE PAST, AND PLANS ON TEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS HOW WE THINK. THE CURRENT SITUATION MIGHT DELAY, SOMETHING MIGHT ACCELERATE, SOMETHING MIGHT CORRECT THE DIRECTION THE TUNESIAN EXPERIENCE WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR US, MORE THAN THE EGYPTIAN. THERE WERE MANY POSITIVE THINGS IN TUNESIA, AND WE ARE SENDING EXPERTS TO LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE. IT IS NOT ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, BUT DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE REGIONS. THESE POINTS WE HAVE OVERCOME IN SYRIA, AND WE HAVE A MORE EQUAL, MORE BALANCED DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN SYRIA BETWEEN REGIONS. IF WE SAY THAT WE DON'T WANT REFORM, WE SAY WE CANNOT STAY WITHOUT REFORM. STAYING WITHOUT REFORM IS A DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY, AND THIS IS WHAT THE CREATIVITY THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROVE AS SYRIANS. WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THE NEW LAWS VERY SHORTLY, THE PACKAGE OF DECISIONS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED THURSDAY DID NOT START FROM SCRATCH, AS I SAID. REGIONAL LEADERSHIP HAD PREPARED DRAFTS OF LAWS REGARDING THE POLITICAL PARTY'S LAW AND THE EMERGENCY LAW MORE THAN A YEAR AGO, IN ADDITION TO OTHER LAWS, DRAFT LAWS, THAT WILL BE PUT INTO THE GENERAL DISCUSSION, AND THEN TO THE CONCERNED INSTITUTIONS UNTIL THEY ARE ADOPTED. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES NOT ANNOUNCED THURSDAY. SOME OF THEM ARE TO REINFORCE THE NATIONAL UNITY, AND OTHERS ARE TO FIGHT CORRUPTION AND ALSO FOR THE MEDIA, AND INCREASING THE UNEMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS SOON AS THEY ARE FINISHED. THE PRIORITY OF NEW GOVERNMENT IS TO RAISE SALARIES. WE ARE DISCUSSING IT WITH THE ECONOMIC TEAM. I WAS THERE. WE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF MEASURES, JUST SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED. AND BY THE WAY, LET ME ADD SOMETHING ABOUT THE 1500 LEAR A SALARY RAISE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT. THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS LAST MEETING YESTERDAY REALLY GOT THIS INITIATIVE. THEY RECEIVED THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, I RECEIVED THE AMENDMENT AND OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TELL THOSE, SAY IT WAS THEIR INITIATIVE, NOT ME. I DID NOT INTERVENE IN THIS. THE PLOTTERS HAVE FAILED OUR PRESIDENT HOLDS ON HIS SHOULDERS THE GLORY OF OUR HISTORY. ALL THE ARAB REGION, WE ARE THE PROTECHORS OF THE ARAB REGION. IN ANY CASE, I AM GOING TO ASK THE PARTIES AND THE INSTITUTIONS AND I HOPE THAT WHEN WE PREFER TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS WHEN ALL IS DONE. WE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR A TIME LINE FOR EACH ONE OF THE MEASURES, AND YOU AS THE PARLIAMENT AND THE COMING PARLIAMENT WILL DETERMINE THESE TIMELINES, BECAUSE THE TIMELINES ARE THE BEST THING, BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REFORMS TAKE PLACE. GIVING A TIME LINE IN THIS ASSEMBLY, IN THIS SPEECH, OF COURSE, I CAN'T DO THAT NOW, OF COURSE. IT'S A LOGISTICAL QUESTION. SO I THINK THAT IT IS IN OUR DUTY TO GIVE TO THIS SALARY OR TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WHAT IS BEST, NOT WHAT IS FAST. IN ANY CASE, SOME ON SATELLITE TV WILL SAY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE WILL TELL THEM WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. AND BY THE WAY, DON'T BE ANGRY TO WHAT SATELLITE TVS HAVE DONE OR WILL DO. THEY ALWAYS FALL IN THE SAME TRAP BECAUSE THEY LIE AND LIE AND LIE UNTIL THEY ADMIT AND THEY FALL INTO THEIR OWN LIES. IN THE NAME OF OUR NATION WHEN THEY CAME OUT YESTERDAY, YOUNG AND OLD TO EXPRESS, MR. PRESIDENT, THEIR LOYALTY TO YOUR WISDOM, GOD IS WITH YOU AND WE ARE WITH YOU. OUR SOUL AND WITH OUR BLOOD, WE SACRIFICE FOR YOU. THE PEOPLE WANT BASHAR ASSAD. AND YOU SHOW ME SO MUCH LOVE WHEN YOU WORK SO HARD FOR THE SYRIAN PEOPLE. THE ARAB WORLD IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU. YOU SHOULD BE A WORLD LEADER. DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, YOU MIGHT HATE SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR YOU, WORDS OF GOD, BUT WE ARE HUMANS. WE CANNOT LOVE WHAT HAPPENED, WE CANNOT LIKE DISSENT. WE CAN LOOK LIKE BLOOD, LOOK LIKE TENSION. BUT CRISES ARE A POSITIVE OPPORTUNITY IF WE CAN CONTROL IT AND GET OUT OF IT VICTORIOUS. THE SECRET OF SUCCESS OF SYRIA IS THE MANY CRISES THAT IT HAS FACED IN THE PAST, PARTICULARLY AFTER INDEPENDENCE WHICH GAVE IT MORE PROTECTION AND MORE POWER, SO WE HAVE TO FACE THE CRISIS WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE, AND WITH GREAT COMMITMENT TO SUCCEED. FEAR HAS TO BECOME A POSITIVE FEELING, NOT A NEGATIVE ONE, THAT PUSHES US FORWARD, NOT TO FLEE FORWARD, NOT TO ESCAPE FORWARD. WHEN WE ESCAPE FORWARD, WE ARE -- WE WILL END UP BY FALLING. MANY PEOPLE DURING CRISIS WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION, NO MATTER HOW, NO MATTER WHAT. SO SOME THINGS ARE BETTER WITHOUT A SOLUTION THAN WITH A BAD SOLUTION, UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT YOUR SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION, YOU ARE BETTER IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING. SO KILLING OR THWARTING THE FRAGMENTATION OF THOSE WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIVISION, THE DIVISION IS WORSE THAN MURDER AS THE KORAN SAYS. THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN IT ARE WILLING TO KILL THEIR OWN COUNTRY. SO THE QUESTION IS NOT THE STATE BUT THE NATION, THE COUNTRY. THE APPLAUSE IS BIG, THE CONSPIRACY IS BIG, AND WE DON'T WANT BATTLES. THE SYRIAN PEOPLE ARE PEACEFUL PEOPLE, BUT WE WILL NOT BLINK IN DEFENDING OUR PRINCIPLES AND OUR RIGHTS. IF THE BATTLE IS FORCED ON US, THEN WELCOME. [ APPLAUSE ] GOD IS WITH YOU AND THE NATION IS WITH YOU, AND YOU WILL TAKE US FROM ONE SUCCESS TO ANOTHER AND WE ARE WITH YOU IN EVERY BATTLE. LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE CONCEPT OF DOMINOS THAT CAME AFTER THE ENVISION OF IRAQ IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN THE U.S., SAID ARAB COUNTRIES ARE DOMINO PIECES AND THEY WILL FALL ONE AFTER THE OTHER. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THESE PROJECTS FELL LIKE A DOMINO EFFECT. AND BECAUSE SOME HAVE VERY SHORT MEMORIES ON THE SATELLITE CHANNELS, LET ME REMIND THEM THAT NOT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ARE CONSPIRACY BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE READY IN THE STUDIOS TO COMMENCE ON THIS SPEECH. BUT YOU, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THIS NATION, YOUR DEDICATION TO YOUR COUNTRY THAT YOU EXPRESS DAY AFTER DAY, MORE CLEARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS, WHAT YOU EXPRESSED YESTERDAY WITH THOSE MASS RALLIES IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY GIVE ME MORE CONFIDENCE AND MAKE ME STEADFAST AND THAT YOU WORK IN FACE OF THE DIVISION, GIVE ME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE, AND IF YOU SAID WITH OUR SOUL AND WITH OUR BLOOD, SACRIFICE FOR YOU, BASHAR, THE RIGHT THING IS TO SAY BASHAR SACRIFICES FOR HIS COUNTRY. AND I ANSWER YOU GOD, SYRIA, THE PEOPLE PEOPLE. I WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE PRODING US SON OF THIS NATION, WILL KEEP WALKING AMONG HIS PEOPLE, SYRIA IS THE RESISTANCE AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

SYR_Doc3_Interv_For,"Q: I will start by talking about the cease-fire in Syria. Russia, the U.S., and several countries say a cease-fire could be revived despite the recent violence and the recrimination. Do you agree, and are you prepared to try again? A: We announced that we are ready to be committed to any halt of operations, or if you want to call it cease-fire, but it's not about Syria or Russia; it's about the United States and the terrorist groups that have been affiliated to ISIS and al-Nusra and al-Qaida, and to the United States and to Turkey and to Saudi Arabia. They announced publicly that they are not committed, and this is not the first attempt to have a halt of operations in Syria. The first attempt was in last February, and didn't work, I think, because of the United States, and I believe that the United States is not genuine regarding having a cessation of violence in Syria. Q: Do you believe there could ever be a joint U.S.-Russian military partnership against the militants, as outlined in the deal? A: Again, practically, yes, but in reality, no, because the United States doesn't have the will to work against al-Nusra or even ISIS, because they believe that this is a card they can use for their own agenda. If they attack al-Nusra or ISIS, they will lose a very important card regarding the situation in Syria. So, I don't believe the United States will be ready to join Russia in fighting terrorists in Syria. Q: This week, the U.S. has said the coalition attack on Syrian troops was an accident. Do you accept that explanation? A: No, no. It's not, because it wasn't an accident by one airplane for once, let's say. It was four airplanes that kept attacking the position of the Syrian troops for nearly one hour, or a little bit more than one hour. You don't commit a mistake for more than one hour. This is first. Second, they weren't attacking a building in a quartier; they were attacking a huge place constituted of many hills, and there was not terrorist adjacent to the Syrian troops there. At the same time, the ISIS troops or the ISIS militants attacked right away after the American strike. How could they know that the Americans are going to attack that position in order to gather their militants to attack right away and to capture it one hour after the strike? So it was definitely intentional, not unintentional as they claimed. Q: Did Syria or Russia launch the attack on the Red Crescent convoy this week, and should Moscow be held responsible, as the White House has said? A: No, first of all, there have been tens, maybe, of convoys from different organizations around the world, coming to different areas in Syria for the last few years. It has never happened before, so why to happen now, either by the Russians or the Syrians? No, it's a claim. And regarding the claim of the White House yesterday, accusing either the Syrians or the Russians. In that regard, I would say whatever the American officials said about the conflicts in Syria in general has no credibility. Whatever they say, it's just lies and, let's say, bubbles, has no foundation on the ground. Q: So what happened to the convoy? Who should be held responsible? A: Those convoys were in the area of the militants, the area under the control of the terrorists. That's what they should accuse first: the people or the militants, the terrorists who are responsible for the security of this convoy. So, we don't have any idea about what happened. The only thing that we saw was a video of a burnt car, destroyed trucks, nothing else. Q: Several eyewitnesses have told AP that 20 missiles were launched against the convoy. There is footage of torn bodies. This does not seem as though it would be anything but an attack from the air. Eyewitnesses are also talking about barrel bombs, and as you are aware, your administration has been accused of using barrel bombs in some circumstances. You still think this was an attack from the ground by rebels? A: Yeah, first of all, even the United Nations said that there were no airstrikes against that convoy. That was yesterday. Second, at the same time of that event, the terrorists were attacking the Syrian troops by missiles. They launched missile attacks, we didn't respond. Third, you cannot talk about eyewitnesses for such judgment or accusation. What are the credibility of those eyewitnesses, who are they? We don't know. Q: We have eyewitnesses that were relatives, we have the White Helmets, we have many people saying that they witnessed helicopters in the air. Now, only the Syrians and the Russians have helicopters. Are you saying this is just invented? A: Those witnesses only appear when there's an accusation against the Syrian Army or the Russian, but when the terrorists commit a crime or massacre or anything, you don't see any witnesses, and you don't hear about those White Helmets. So, what a coincidence. No, actually, we don't have any interest in doing so for one reason: because if we attack any convoy that's going to the civilians, we are working for the interest of the terrorists, that will play into their hands directly, in that regard we are pushing the civilians toward the terrorists, we put them in their laps, and we are providing the terrorists with a good incubator, something we wouldn't do. This is first. Second, we are, as a government, as officials, we are committed morally toward the Syrian people, morally, constitutionally, and legally, to help them in every aspect to have the basic needs for their livelihood. Q: Your administration has denied the use of chemical weapons, of barrel bombs, despite testimony and video and the results of a U.N. investigation. We also are hearing similar denials about airstrikes on civilians and medical workers. Can this all be false allegations by your opponents? A: First of all, the first incident of gas use in Syria was in Aleppo about more than three years ago, and we were the ones who invited the United Nations to send a delegation for investigations about the use of chemical weapons, and the United States objected and opposed that action for one reason; because if there's investigations, they're going to discover that the terrorists used gas, not the Syrian Army. In that regard, in that case, the United States won't be able to accuse Syria. That's why they were opposing that delegation. In every incident, we asked the United Nations to send a delegation, and we are still insisting on that position, that they have to send delegations to make investigation, but the United States is opposing. So, actually, if we've been using that, we wouldn't ask for investigation. Q: To the international community, it seems as though none of the charges or accusations stick, that everything is denied, everything here is ok, by your administration. Do you not feel that that undermines the credibility? In other instances, the Americans for example admitted the attack on the Syrian military was a mistake. Now, you don't accept that, but from the Syrian administration, all the international community hears is denial. A: Regarding which issue? Q: Regarding the accusations of violations of human rights, of barrel bombs... A: Look, if you want to talk about mistakes, every country has mistakes, every government has mistakes, every person has mistakes. When you have a war, you have more mistakes. That's the natural thing. But the accusations have no foundation regarding Syria. When they talk about barrel bombs, what are barrel bombs? It's just a title they use in order to show something which is very evil that could kill people indiscriminately, and as I said, because in the media ""when it bleeds, it leads."" They don't talk about bombs; they call it barrel bombs. A bomb is a bomb, what's the difference between different kinds of bombs? All bombs are to kill, but it's about how to use it. When you use an armament, you use it to defend the civilians. You kill terrorists in order to defend civilians. That's the natural role of any army in the world. When you have terrorists, you don't throw at them balloons or you don't use rubber sticks, for example. You have to use armaments. So, it's not about what the kind of armament, it's about how to use it, and they want to use it that time to accuse the Syrian Army of killing civilians. We don't kill civilians, because we don't have the moral incentive, we don't have the interest to kill civilians. It's our people, who support us. If you want to kill the Syrian people, who's going to support us as a government, as officials? No one. So, in reality, you cannot withstand for five years and more against all those countries, the West, and the Gulf states, the petrodollars, and all this propaganda, the strongest media corporations around the world, if you don't have the support of your own people. That's against the reality. So, no, we don't use it. I wouldn't say that we don't have mistakes. Again, that many mistakes that have been committed by individuals, but there's a difference between a mistake or even a crime that's been committed by an individual, and between a policy of crime that's been implemented or adopted by a government. We don't have such a policy. Q: And yet the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who are fleeing the country, many drowning on the way, many of them say they are fleeing your forces. What exactly are they fleeing if this campaign doesn't exist, if this campaign of violence, indiscriminate against them...? A: You have to look at the reality in Syria. Whenever we liberate any city or village from the terrorists, the civilians will go back to the city, while they flee that city when the terrorists attack that area, the opposite. So, they flee, first of all, the war itself; they flee the area under the control of the terrorists, they flee the difficult situation because of the embargo by the West on Syria. So, many people, they flee not the war itself, but the consequences of the war, because they want to live, they want to have the basic needs for their livelihood, they don't have it. They have to flee these circumstances, not necessarily the security situation itself. So, you have different reasons for the people or the refugees to leave Syria. Many many of them supported the government in the recent elections, the presidential elections, in different countries. So, that's not true that they left Syria because of the government, and those accusations mean that the government is killing the people, while the terrorists, mainly al-Qaida and al-Nusra and other al-Qaida-affiliated organizations or groups protected the civilians. Is that the accusation? No-one can believe it, actually. Q: Let's turn our attention to the people that can't flee, the people who are in besieged cities around Syria. For example, Aleppo. To go back to the cease-fire agreement, aid was supposed to get into the city, but you did not hold up your end of the agreement. Why was that, and how can you really justify withholding aid to cities? A: Again, if we talk about the last few years, many aid convoys came to different cities, so why does the Syrian government prevent a convoy from coming to Aleppo for example, while allowing the others to reach other areas? This is contradiction, you cannot explain it, it's not palatable. This is first. Second, if you look at the others areas under the control of the terrorists, we're still sending vaccines from the Syrian government's budget, we're still sending salaries to the employees from the Syrian government's budget. So, how can we do this and at the same time push the people toward starvation in other areas? More importantly, the terrorists who left liberated areas under what you call reconciliation or certain agreements in different areas, they left to fight with other terrorists in Syria while they send their families to live under the supervision of the government. Why didn't we put those families to starvation? So, this is contradicting, I mean what you're talking about is contradicting the reality, and we don't contradict ourselves. Q: But the world saw the reality of Aleppo. There were U.N. convoys of aid that were not allowed into the city. Are you denying that that was the case? A: The situation has been like this for years now. If there's really a siege around the city of Aleppo, people would have been dead by now. This is first. Second, more importantly, they've been shelling the neighboring areas and the positions of the Syrian Army for years, non-stop shelling of mortars and different kinds of lethal bombs. How could they be starving while at the same time they can have armaments? How can we prevent the food and the medical aid from reaching that area and we cannot stop the armaments form reaching that area, which is not logical? Q: So what is your message to the people to Aleppo, who are saying the opposite, that they are hungry, that they are suffering malnutrition, that there are no doctors, that doctors have been targeted and killed in airstrikes, that they are under siege and they are dying? What is your message to them? A: You can't say ""the people of Aleppo"" because the majority of the people of Aleppo are living in the area under the control of the government, so you cannot talk about the people of Aleppo. If you want to talk about some who allegedly are claiming this, we tell them how could you still be alive? Why don't you have, for example, an epidemic, if you don't have doctors? How could you say that we attacked, they accuse Syria of attacking hospitals, so you have hospitals and you have doctors and you have everything. How could you have them? How could you have armaments? That's the question. How can you get armaments to your people, if you claim that you have people and grassroots while you don't have food? They have to explain; I don't have to explain. The reality is telling. Q: Yet, they say the opposite. They say they are surviving on whatever they can, on meager means, and they are a city under siege. You do not accept that Aleppo is a city under siege with people starving and hungry? A: Again, how can I prevent the food, and not prevent the armament? Logically, how? If I can prevent food, I should be able to prevent armaments. If I don't prevent armaments, that means everything else will pass to Aleppo. Q: Have you been to Aleppo recently? Will you go to Aleppo? A: Of course I will go. Q: And how does it feel for you to see the devastation in parts of what was known as the jewel of Syria? A: Devastation is painful, of course, but we can rebuild our country. We're going to do that. Someday the war will stop. The most painful is the devastation of the society, the killing, the blood-shedding, something we live with every hour and every day. But how would I think? I think when I see those pictures how would Western officials feel when they look at this devastation and these killing pictures and they know that their hands are stained with their blood, that they committed the crime directly in killing those people and destroying our civilization. That's what I think about. Q: Yet, to the outside world, it feels as though the end justifies any means in your war on terror. Do you accept that? A: They don't have morals, of course. This is a Machiavellian principle; the end justifies the means. We don't accept it, no. Your policy should be a mixture between your interests and how you reach your ends, but based on values. It cannot be only the end justifies the means, because for the criminals, ends justify the means, for thieves, for every illegal and immoral action, the end justifies the means. That's exactly what you mentioned in your question, this is the base, the foundation of the Western policy around the world these days. Q: What is your message to the Syrians who have fled the country? Some of them didn't make it, others did. Do you call on them to come back, do you expect them to come back? A: Of course. It's a loss, it's a great loss. The worst loss for any country is not the infrastructure or the buildings or the material loss; actually, it's the human resources loss, something we want to see coming back to Syria, and I'm sure that the majority of those Syrians who left Syria, they will go back when the security and when the life goes back to its normality and the minimal requirements for livelihood will be affordable to them, they will go back. I am not worried about this. Q: Do you have any expectation of when that will happen, when Syria will be pacified to some degree that they can come back? A: If we look at it according to the internal Syrian factors, I would say it's very soon, a few months, and I'm sure about that, I'm not exaggerating, but when you talk about it as part of a global conflict and a regional conflict, when you have many external factors that you don't control, it's going to drag on and no-one in this world can tell you when but the countries, the governments, the officials who support directly the terrorists. Only they know, because they know when they're going to stop supporting those terrorists, and this is where the situation in Syria is going to be solved without any real obstacles. Q: So, let's just dwell on that point for a moment. Do you believe that within a couple of months the situation in Syria will have dramatically changed in your favor to the point that refugees can come back? A: No, because I don't believe that in a couple of months Erdogan and the United States regime, and the Western regimes in general, and of course Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are going to stop the support of the terrorists. I don't see it in the next two months. Q: So how can you really incite Syrians to come back in two months as you said? A: I said if there are no external factors. I said if you look at it as an isolated case, as a Syrian case, which is theoretical, I mean, this is where you can say that in few months you can solve it. But now you're talking about an arena which is part of the international and regional arena, not isolated. So, this is why I said no-one has the answer when will it end. Q: It's now one year since Russia got involved in the war. Before the intervention you were losing territory and control. Did you ever feel like you were losing the war? A: We didn't look at it that way, to lose the war, because whenever you have Syrians working with the terrorists, it's a loss. How to lose the war, this is hypothetical question, to be frank. It's not about your feeling; it's about the reality. In the war, you lose areas, but you recapture another area. So, it is difficult to tell whether you are losing or gaining or it was a standstill. No-one has this answer. But definitely, after the Russian intervention and supporting the Syrian Army, legally of course, we felt much, much better. We captured many main cities, many main positions at the expense of the terrorists' areas. Q: Even if you were to win the war, what would be left of your country and Syrian society? Will you have to think again about the prospect of a partition in Syria? A: No, we never thought about it, and the majority in Syria don't believe in this, and I don't think the reality, in spite of this savage war, has created the atmosphere for such partition. Actually, in many areas, the social situation is much better, because when you want to talk about partition you need to find these borders between the social communities. You cannot have partition only on political bases or geographic bases. It should be social first of all when the communities do not live with each other. As a result of the war, many Syrians understand that the only way to protect your country is to live with each other with integration, not only in coexistence, which is actually more precise to call cohabitation, when people interact and integrate with each other on daily basis in every detail. So, I think in this regard I am more assured that Syria will be more unified. So, the only problem now that we face is not the partition, but terrorism. Q: And yet you are not seen as a unifying force in Syria; people think that the society is torn apart. Just to use one example, on a personal level, you trained as a doctor and yet your administration stands accused of targeting medical and rescue workers as they race to save lives. How do you make peace with this? And is this a society that, after suffering such consequences, can really just forget the past and move on? A: I cannot answer that question while it's filled with misinformation. Let us correct it first. We don't attack any hospital. Again, as I said, this is against our interests. If you put aside the morals, that we do not do it morally, if I put it aside, I am talking about now, let's say, the ends justify the means, if I want to use it, we don't have interest. This is how we can help the terrorists if we attack hospitals, schools, and things like this. Of course, whenever you have a war, the civilians and the innocents will pay the price. That's in any war, any war is a bad war. There is no good war. In any war, people will pay the price, but I'm talking about the policy of the government, of the army; we don't attack any hospital. We don't have any interest in attacking hospitals. So, what is the other part of the question? Sorry, to remind me. Q: That's ok, that fits into the general question, but I would like to follow up with: others say the opposite, including medical workers and including the Syrian White Helmets. If you value their work, racing to the scene of whatever it may, to try and save lives, does that mean you would support the recent nomination of the White Helmets for a Nobel Peace Prize? A: It is not about the White Helmets, whether they are credible or not, because some organizations are politicized, but they use different humanitarian masks and umbrellas just to implement certain agenda. But, generally if you want to talk about the humanitarian support, how can I attack hospitals while I am sending vaccines, for example? Just explain it. You tell me two different things, two contradicting things; one that I am talking about is reality, because everybody knows that we are sending vaccines, the other one is that we are attacking hospitals. They do not match. Q: Would you support them for a Nobel Peace Prize? A: Who? Q: The White Helmets. A: What did they achieve in Syria? And how un-politicized is the Nobel Prize? That's the other question. So, if I get an answer to these two questions, I can answer you. But I would only give a prize to whoever works for the peace in Syria, first of all by stopping the terrorists from flowing towards Syria, only. Q: My last question: The U.S. election is now just a few weeks away. How do you expect that a Clinton or Trump presidency would differ in terms of U.S. policy towards Syria, and specifically towards you? A: The problem with every American candidate regarding the presidency, I am not talking only about this campaign or elections, but generally, that they say something during the campaign and they do the opposite after the campaign. As we see now the American officials, they say something in the morning and they do the opposite in the evening. So, you cannot judge those people according to what they say. You cannot take them at their words, to be frank. We don't listen to their statements, we don't care about it, we don't believe it. We have to wait till they become presidents, we have to watch their policy and their actions and their behaviors. We do not have a lot of expectations, we never had. We have hopes that we can see rational American presidents; fair, obey the international law, deal with other countries according to mutual respect, parity, etc., but we all know that this is only wishful thinking and fantasy."

SYR_Doc7_Interv_For,"CBS One small point about American involvement here. The President has gotten significant criticism because he has not supported the rebels more. As you know, there was an argument within his own counsels, from Secretary of State, Clinton, from CIA, Director David Petraeus, from the Defense Department, Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense, and others, that they should have helped the rebels two years ago, and we would be in a very different place. So the President has not given enough support to the rebels, in the view of many people, and there's criticism that when he made a recent decision to give support, it has not gotten to the rebels, because they worry about the composition. Assad If the American administration wanted to support al Qaeda, go ahead. That's what we have to tell them. Go ahead and support al Qaeda, but don't talk about rebels and army and so on. The majority of fighters now are al Qaeda. If you want to support them, you are supporting al Qaeda. You are creating havoc in the region. And if this region is not stable, the whole world cannot be -- CBS With respect, sir, most people don't believe the majority of the forces are al Qaeda. Yes, there's a number of people who are al Qaeda affiliates and and who subscribe to the principles of al Qaeda. But that's not the majority of the forces, as you know. I mean, you know that the composition differs within the regions of Syria as to the forces that are fighting against your regime. Assad The American officials should learn to deal with reality. Why did the United States fail in most of its wars? Because it always based its wars on the wrong information. So whether they believe or not, this is not reality. I have to be very clear and very honest. I'm not asking them to believe. If they don't want to believe -- this is reality. I'm telling you the reality from our country. We live here, we know what's happening, and they have to listen to people who live there. They cannot listen only to their media or to their research centers. They don't live here. No one lives here but us. So this is the reality, if they want to believe that's good, that will help them understanding the region and being more successful in their policies. CBS Many people think this is not a sustainable position here, that this war cannot continue because the cost for Syria is too high. Too many deaths, 100,000 and counting, too many refugees, too much destruction. The soul of a country at risk. If it was for the good of the country, would you step down? Assad That depends on the relation between me staying in this position and the conflict. We cannot discuss it just to say you have to step down. To step down, why? What's the expected result? This is first. Second, when you're in the middle of a storm, leaving your country just because you have to leave without any reasonable reason, it means you're getting your quitting your country, and this is treason. CBS So it would be you're saying it would be treason for you to step down right now because of your obligation. Assad Unless, unless the public wants you to quit. CBS And how will you determine that? Assad By the two years and a half withstanding. Without the public support, we cannot withsand two years and a half, look at the other countries, look what happened in Libya and Tunisia and Egypt. CBS Do you worry about that? What happened to Gaddafi? What happened to -- Assad No, we are worrying that the rebels are taking control in many countries. And look at the results, now. Are you satisfied as American, with the results? Nothing. Very bad, nothing good."
SYR_Doc_Speech_Dom,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CITIZENS, PLEASE BE UPON YOU UP ON SYRIA AND ALL THOSE PROTECTING MINISTERIAL -- THIS DEAR LAND. UPON THE PEOPLE, THE ARMY CAN THE SECURITY FORCES AND ALL THOSE WORKING NONSTOP TO, FERMENTING REBELLION, CUTTING IT OFF THEM. IT IS BECAUSE WHERE IT EVERY CHILD WHO IS FOSTERFATHER AND EVERY FAMILY WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE, PEACE BE UPON THE SOULS OF OUR MARCHES WHOSE BLOOD HAS SPROUTED ALMONDS IN THE SPRINGS AND OTHER, WHILE THE SEASONS OF BLOSSOMING OF FRUIT HAVE BEEN REPLACED A SEASONS OF CONSPIRACY AND KILLING. BUT EVEN SEASONS OF CONSPIRACY IN LIBYA, THEY BLOOM PRIDE AND HUMILITY. TODAY AND THROUGH YOU, ADDRESS EVERY SERIOUS CITIZEN THAT THE LAND. I WILL SPEAK TO YOU DIRECTLY IN ORDER TO DO INTERNATIONAL SPONTANEITY THAT HAPPENED TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR RELATIONSHIP. I WISH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT EVERY SEER AND A PERSON, BUT I KNOW MANY OF YOU ON ANY OCCASION MAKES ME FEEL I AM INDICATING WITH ALL OF YOU. ARE YOU, I WOULD LIKE TO SEND MY GREETINGS TO EVERY CITIZEN, TO EVERY BROTHER AND SISTER, TO EVERY YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN, TO EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER, EXPRESSING THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR NATIONAL UNITY AND WORKING HARD IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE COUNTRY'S SAFETY WHILE GIVING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER IN ORDER FOR IT TO REMAIN STRONG. IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO ADDRESS YOU, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME OF THOSE I MET RECENTLY VISUALLY TO SPEAK SOONER TO THE CITIZENS. IT HAS TAKEN ME THIS TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE MY SPEECH A PLATFORM FOR PROPAGANDA IT DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL ACHIEVE, BUT RATHER ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED OR WHAT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ACHIEVED. I WANTED THE SUBSTANCE OF MY SPEECH TO BE BASED ON WHAT I HAVE HEARD TOO MANY MEETINGS OF SYRIAN CITIZENS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. CREDIBILITY COME WHICH HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND I CAN WHICH IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF TIME THESE RATHER THAN WORDS AND SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN FORM. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF TRUST IN THE MEETINGS I HAVE RECENTLY FELT. OTHER MEETINGS INCLUDED SMALL GROUPS, WHEN COMPARED TO THE LARGER IS THE PURITY COUNTRY IN POPULATION, THEY ESTABLISHED THE GREATEST OF OUR PEOPLE WHO PUT PATRIOTIC AWARENESS, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND PRIDE. OF COURSE, DELAY MAY SPEECH UNTIL TODAY GAVE ME RISE TO MANY RUMORS IN THE COUNTRY. RIMMER SAID WE HAVE THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT, BUT MOST IMPORT THIS TIME. SO EVERY POPULAR DELEGATION THAT MET WITH. AS FOR THE RUMORS, NELLIE DELEGATION SAID, WANTED TO CHECK ON ME PERSONALLY TO VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE TURNER SPIRIT I WANT TO SAY THAT EVERY RUMOR YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY AND HIS WORK IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT MERIT. ALL OF THEM WITH A MALICIOUS OR RATHER ARE IRRELEVANT AND UNTRUE. [APPLAUSE] TODAY WE MEET AN IMPORTANT JUNCTURE IN THE HISTORY OF A NATION. THIS IS A MOMENT IN WHICH THROUGH OUR WILL AND DETERMINATION WE STRIVE TO MAKE A POINT OF DEPARTURE FROM A PAST BURDENED WITH PAIN AND UNREST, WERE INNOCENT BLOOD WAS SHED, WHICH HAS PAINED THE HEART OF EVERY SYRIAN FOR THE PRESENCE OF HURRYING TRANQUILITY WILL RETURN BASED ON STRONG FOUNDATIONS WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES. RECENT HEAVY PRICE IN TERMS OF SECURITY AND STABILITY. WHAT HAPPENED WAS AN UNSUSPENDED ORDEAL THAT OVERSHADOWED OUR COUNTRY AND LED TO A SITUATION OF DISTRESS. THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN TERRORIZING THE POPULATION AND SABOTAGING PUBLIC PRIVATE PROPERTY, WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE SPIKE THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS. A NUMBER OF MARCHERS AT ANOTHER'S FURNITURE. THEY ARE ORDINARY CITIZENS HAVE THE SECURITY AND ARMED FORCES WHO DOES A GREAT LOSS TO FAMILIES ONES COME A GREAT LAST OF THE HOMELAND AND FOR ME, PERSONALLY AND EXTREMELY HEAVY LAST. I PRAY ALMIGHTY GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE SOULS OF ALL MURDERS AND I OFFER MY DEEP AND HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO FAMILIES AND RELATIVES. INASMUCH AS WE FEEL THE LOSS AND PAIN WE ARE PROMPTED TO CONTEMPLATE THIS PROFOUND AND IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE, BOTH IN ITS NEGATIVE ASPECTS AND THE IMPLICATION OF LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY AND INCOME, BOTH MATERIAL AND IMMORAL SCUM IN TERMS OF ITS HUSBAND AND FOR ALL OF US. WE DISCOVERED OUR NATIONAL ELEMENTS FOR THE STRENGTHENED STURDINESS DID ON THE ONE HAND AND WEAKNESS ON THE OTHER. THIS TIME CANNOT BE TRANSACT, OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO LOOK FORWARD. WE TAKE THIS ACTUALLY DECIDE TO SHOOT THE FUTURE RATHER THAN STANDING BY AND LETTING THE FUTURE SHAPE US IN THE EVENT AROUND US. THIS MEANS THAT WE SHOULD BUILD UPON WHICH EXPERIENCE AND A DEEP ANALYSIS THAT EXTRAPOLATES LESSONS THAT WE CAN TURN LOSSES INTO WINS. THEREBY BECOMES SACRIFICIAL NOURISHMENT TO STRENGTHEN THE COUNTRY. IN ALL THIS, WE KEEP LOOKING FORWARD WELL TAKEN A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE PAST, WITH AN ARROW POINTING TO THE PRESENT. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE COMMON QUESTION TODAY IS, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HER COUNTRY AND WHY IT? IS IT A CONSPIRACY? AND IF SO, WHO STANDS BEHIND THEIR CLIENT IS THAT OUR FAULT? IF SO, THERE ARE QUESTIONS DURING THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A STAGE IN HISTORY WHERE IT WAS NOT THE TARGET OR SOME SORT OF CONSPIRACY, A BEFORE AND AFTER THEY TOOK PLACE FOR MANY REASONS , SOME RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHERS LINKED TO ASSIST IN ITS PRINCIPLES AND INTERESTS. CONSPIRACY LIKE GERMS, MULTIPLYING EVERY MOMENT EVERYWHERE. THEY CANNOT BE ELIMINATED, WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE MINTY FOR ABOUT A SURGE PROTECTOR SO SICK OF THEM. BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN POLITICAL POLITICS AND MEDIA COME IT DOESN'T MUCH ANALYSIS TO PROVE THAT THERE IS INDEED A CONSPIRACY. WE SHOULD NOT WASTE TIME DISCUSSING NEVER BEEN FRIGHTENED BY IT. RATHER, WE SHOULD BE A WILL TO IDENTIFY THE INTERNAL WEAKNESSES THROUGH WHICH THIS CONSPIRACY CAN INFILTRATE THE COUNTRY. THEN, WE SHOULD CORRECT THESE WEAKNESSES. THAT WOULD NOT BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE CONSPIRACY'S PLAN FOR US AT THE COUNTRY SEATED INSIDE COULD BE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE WEEK HAS ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO INTERFERE BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IN THE END IS TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS AND AVOID RAMIFICATIONS THAT WEAKEN OUR NATIONAL IMMUNITY. EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT, THOUGHT THAT WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNITY OF OUR BODIES. IT IS WHAT WE MUST THINK OF BECAUSE IT IS CERTAINLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING THE CONSPIRACY. I DON'T THINK THEY SHOW ALL DETAILS ANYTIME SOON, PROBABLY THE TRIPLE MAY EMERGE FOR YEARS TO COME. SOMEHOW THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY. THIS IS ALSO NOT THE OBJECT IS. NOT ONLY FOR THE CRISIS, BUT FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SYRIA. THE POLITICAL POSITIONS WHO ARE APPLYING PRESSURE AND AREA, TRYING TO INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT OF CONCERN, BUT RATHER THE TARGET THE PRICE WE KNOW IN ADVANCE, PUSHING US TO ABANDON OUR PRINCIPLES RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. WHAT DO WE SAY ABOUT THESE POSITIONS IN THE MEDIA PRESSURE? WHAT WE SAY ABOUT SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM IN SYRIA AND ABOUT THE FRAUD WE WITNESSED RECENTLY? WE CERTAINLY CANNOT SAY THIS IS AN ACT OF CHARITY. IT IS SIMPLY CONSPIRACY, BUT AGAIN WE WILL NOT WASTE OUR TIME DISCUSSING IT. I SAID THIS BEFORE MISFEATURE FOR THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY AND THE CABINET WE MUST FOCUS ON DOMESTIC AND TODAY'S FEATURE WILL ONLY ADDRESS DOMESTIC SITUATION WITHOUT REFERRING TO EXTERNAL FACTORS ARE NEITHER PUBLICLY NOR NEGATIVELY. [APPLAUSE] WHAT HAPPENS ON THE STREETS HAS THREE COMPONENTS AS BUILT IN ANSWERING THAT THEY WANT TO ME. HAS SPOKEN ABOUT DEMAND, ONE OF THE DUTIES OF THE STATE STREET CITIZENS COW WHICH SHOULD WORK TIRELESSLY TO MEET THOSE DEMANDS TO MEET THOSE CAPACITIES. ALL OF THOSE SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM, TALK TO THEM AND HELP THEM UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF PUBLIC ORDER. DOES NOT JUSTIFY DEMANDS OF THE PEOPLE. YET, THE URGENT NEED FOR SOME PEOPLE DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE SPREADING OF CHAOS, THE BREAKING OF LAWS AND ARMING OF PUBLIC INTEREST. AND THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO BELONG AND HAVE ME COME I DO NOT MEAN THE DEMONSTRATORS IN SPECIFIC AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THESE COME IN MANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE NEEDS THAT DO NOT DEMONSTRATE, SO WE NEED TO DO WITH THEM AS WELL. .. RATHER THAN BE MARGINALIZED. THEY WANT JUSTICE. MANY ISSUES WERE RAISED. FOR INSTANCE THERE WERE ACCUMULATED ISSUES DATING BACK THREE DECADES SINCE THE CONCENTRATION WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. THAT WAS A DARK PHASE AND THE NEW GENERATIONS ARE STILL PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT PERIOD LIKE THEY REFUSE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT FOR EXAMPLE OR NOT BEING GIVEN SECURITY CLEARANCES. IN OTHER WORDS, WE HELD CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE, WHICH WAS NOT RIGHT. WE HAVE STARTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I HEARD THESE THINGS FROM OTHER DELEGATIONS, FROM MANY DELEGATIONS THAT I MENTIONED FROM -- DURING OUR MEETING. WE WILL SOLVE THEM COMPLETELY. WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF THE DARK PHASE OF OUR HISTORY THAT HAPPENED THREE DECADES AGO. THESE ISSUES RELATE TO THE INJUSTICE EVERY CITIZEN CAN ASSOCIATE WITH. ALTHOUGH TWO YEARS AGO WE INSTRUCTED ALL AMBASSADORS TO START ISSUING PASSPORTS EVEN TO THOSE WHO ARE WANTED, WHETHER THEY FLED THE COUNTRY OR BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE WANTED IN SYRIA. A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WERE AFRAID THEY COULD NOT GO TO THE EMBASSIES TO RECEIVE THEIR PASSPORTS. EVEN AFTER THE MOST RECENT AMNESTY WAS DECLARED, THEY DID NOT COLLECT YOUR PASSPORTS. THEY INSTILL A KIND OF FEAR WHICH PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM MAKING INITIATIVE TOWARDS STATE INSTITUTIONS. THIS MAKES THEM FEEL INJUSTICE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS INJUSTICE DOES NOT EXIST. TALKING ABOUT AMNESTY IN MY RECENT MEETINGS I THOUGHT IT DID NOT SATISFY MANY PEOPLE. THE FACT IS IT IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AMNESTY AND 23 YEARS. I BELIEVE A SIMILAR ONE WEB WAS GIVEN IN 1988. WE DO NOT USUALLY ADDRESS NAMES. WE PUT CRITERIA LIKE SAY WE GIVE AMNESTY TO ALL EXCEPT DRUGS, TERRORISM, WEAPONS AND ISSUES OF POOR -- PUBLIC MORALITY EPHEDRA. INSTEAD SIGHT OF THIS AND THEY SOMEONE I HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND INFORMATION I RECEIVE FROM PEOPLE I DID NOT MEET I WILL ASK THE JUSTICE TO CONDUCT THE MARGINS WE CAN USE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS AMNESTY MORE COMPREHENSIVE. EVEN IN THE FUTURE DECADE, PARDON ME, DECREE WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE OTHER WITHOUT UNDERMINING STATE SECURITY AND INTERESTS. ON THE ONE HAND ON THE RIGHTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS LIKE THOSE RELATIVES WHOSE RELATIVES WERE KILLED. THE SECOND COMPONENT CONSISTS OF OUTLAWS AND THOSE WHO ARE WANTED FOR VARIOUS CRIMINAL CASES WHO FOUND IN THE STATE INSTITUTIONS AND OUR ENEMY AND THE TARGET BECAUSE IT POSES AN OBSTACLE TO THEIR LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN BECAUSE THEY ARE SOUGHT BY STATE INSTITUTIONS. FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD BE GRASPED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A REMAIN FREE. THIS IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE SEEK TO ENFORCE THE LAW ON ALL. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS WITH THE SOCIAL ASPECT. IN ORDER TO STEER THOSE PEOPLE FROM TAKING THE WRONG PATH AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO BE GOOD CITIZENS TO FULLY INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY. YOU MAY BE ASKING HOW MANY OUTLIERS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE? I MYSELF WAS SURPRISED AT THIS NUMBER. THE CRISIS WAS MORE THAN 64,000 PEOPLE. IMAGINE THIS NUMBER OF WANTED PERSONS FOR CRIMINAL CASES, THE SENTENCING OF WHICH RANGES BETWEEN A FEW MONTHS AND EXECUTION AND THEY HAD ESCAPED JUSTICE. OF COURSE A FEW DAYS AGO THAT NUMBER DROPPED SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 63,000 BECAUSE SOME OF THEM TURN THEMSELVES IN TO AUTHORITIES. DOES THE NUMBER 64,000 IS APPROXIMATE BUT WHICH EQUALS IN MILITARY TERMS ALMOST FIVE MILITARY DIVISION, ALMOST A WHOLE ARMY. WITH A FEW THOUSAND OF THOSE WANTED TO CARRY WEAPONS AND ENGAGE IN SABOTAGE, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT DAMAGE THEY CAN CAUSE TO THE STATES. THE THIRD AND MORE DANGEROUS COMPONENT, DESPITE THE SMALL SIZE, IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXTREMIST IDEOLOGIES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF IDEOLOGY DECADES AGO WHEN IT TRIED TO INFILTRATE SYRIA AND ELIMINATE WISDOM AND INTELLIGENCE. THAT IDEOLOGY TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE SAW DECADES AGO. WHAT HAS CHANGED HOWEVER IS THE METHODS AND THE PERSON. THIS KIND OF IDEOLOGY LURKS IN BACK CORNERS IN ORDER TO EMERGE WHEN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN IT FINDS IT A HANDY MASSA PUT ON. IT KILLS THE NAME OF RELIGION, DESTROYERS IN THE NAME OF REFORM AND SPREAD CHAOS IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM. IT IS SAID TO SEE GROUPS THAT BELONG TO BYGONE AGES THAT BELONG TO A PERIOD WE DO NOT LIVE IN AND DO NOT WANT TO. IN FACT THIS IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE REFORM PROCESS BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT STARTS WITH HUMAN BEINGS. DOES NOT START WITH COMPUTERS. IT DOES NOT START WITH MACHINES. DOES NOT START WITH LEGISLATION OR ANYTHING ELSE. IT STARTS WITH HUMAN BEINGS. THEREFORE WE HAVE TO CONTAIN THIS IDEOLOGY OF THE REALLY WANT TO DEVELOP. IN ANY CASE I DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE COMPONENTS OF THIS CRISIS. I DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE COMPONENTS THAT WE ALL KNOW. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL PAID TO FILM VIDEO AND COLLABORATE WITH THE MEDIA. SOME ARE BEING PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN DEMONSTRATIONS FOR A FEW MINUTES. THESE ACTIONS -- THIS IS WHY I AM RECALLING THE EVENTS OF CHAOS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE RESPONSE TO EVERY REFORM ANNOUNCER ACCOMPLISH. WHERE THEY LOST ALL THIS VACATION TAKING TO ARMS WAS THE ONLY AVAILABLE CHOICE REMAINING TO THEM IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THEIR PLAN. IN SOME CASES PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS REUSED AS A COVER UNDER WHICH ARMED MEN TOOK COVER AND IN OTHER CASES THEY ATTACK CIVILIANS, POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS BY ATTACKING MILITARY SITES AND POSITIONS OR ASSASSINATIONS. SCHOOLS SHOPS AND HIGHWAYS WERE CLOSED BY THE USE OF FORCE AND PUBLIC PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED, RANSACKED AND PUT TO FIRE DELIBERATELY. ALL OF THIS HAS POSED A DIRECT THREAT TO THE NORMAL DAILY LIVES OF CITIZENS AND UNDERMINE SECURITY, EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND COMMUNICATING WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THEY DISTORTED THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND OPEN THE WAY AND EVEN CALLED FOR FOREIGN INTERVENTION. BY DOING SO THEY TRY TO TRIED TO WEAKEN THE NATIONAL POLITICAL STANCE WHICH ADDS YEARS TO THE FULL RETURN OF NATIONAL RIGHTS. THEY INVOKED SET TERRY IN DISCOURSE FOR WHICH WE ARE NEVER ENDORSED TO WHICH WE ONLY SEE AN EXPRESSION OF A HATEFUL IDEOLOGY WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PART OF OUR RELIGION, HIS CHURCH ADDITION AND THE SACRILEGE TO OUR PAN ARAB AND MORAL IDENTITY. IN ALL THESE ISSUES AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST COMPONENT, I AM TALKING ABOUT A SMALL MINORITY WHICH CONSTITUTES ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT CAUSE FOR CONCERN THAT ONCE AGAIN I SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. WHEN THEY FAILED IN THE FIRST COMPONENT, THOSE WHO HAVE DEMANDS THEY MOVE TO ARMED CONFRONTATION ACTS OF VIOLENCE. IN A FIELD AND THAT THE MOVE TO A NEW KIND OF ACTION. THEY STARTED BY COMMITTING ATROCITIES AND MASSACRES WHOSE IMAGES WE SAW IN THE MEDIA WHEN THEY KILLED SECURITY MEN AND DESTROYED THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE IS PUBLIC PROPERTY USED BY THE PEOPLE OF THAT CITY. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF HATRED. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY POSSESS SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS WHICH DID NOT EXIST BEFORE. THEY HAVE SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. THEY MOVE TO ANOTHER KIND OF ACTION. NEAR THE TOWN OF -- TO TRY TO ATTACK STRATEGIC FUEL AND GAS DEPOTS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEM WHICH FORCED THE MILITARY TO INTERVENE AND RECLAIM THEM. WE WERE SURPRISED THAT THEY HAD MODERN FOUR WILL DRIVE VEHICLES ON WHICH THEY INSTALLED SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH HELICOPTERS. THEY ALSO HAD COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT. THEY TRIED TO COMMIT ANOTHER MASSACRE AGAINST THE SECURITY CHECKPOINT. SOME OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE PAY THE PRICE BY BEING TORTURED IN HAVING THEIR BONES BROKEN. I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF ALL THOSE WHO TOOK THIS STEP AND HOPE TO MEET THEM SOON. OF COURSE THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO TRY TO DO SIMILAR THINGS TO PRESENT POSITIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF SERIOUS. MANY OF THEM SUCCEEDED IN SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED SO FAR HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR FOR THE PATRIOTIC SENTIMENT THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE. THE SITUATION HERE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. THE RESPONSE CAME FROM THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONCE AGAIN COME UP TO EXPRESS THEIR NATIONAL AND PATRIOTIC FEELINGS IN A MATTER MANNER WHICH EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS AND AN UNPRECEDENTED HYPOTHETICAL ATTACK WHICH MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH REALITY FROM ILLUSION AND THE CHILDREN FROM THE FAKE BUT THE PATRIOTIC SENTIMENT AND INTUITION THAT A PEOPLE POSSESS AND WHICH ARE BASED ON AN ACCUMULATION OF EXPERIENCES ACROSS GENERATIONS ARE MORE POWERFUL. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS EXPERIENCE THEM IS THAT IT SHOWS THE EXTENT OF NATIONAL AND PATRIOTIC AWARENESS, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GUARANTEE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND MODERNIZATION PROCESS FOR EMBARKING UPON AND WHICH IS BASED ON THREE PILLARS. AWARENESS, MORALS, AND INSTITUTIONS. THE ABSENCE OF ANY OF THOSE PILLARS WILL DEFINITELY LEAD TO A -- OF THE PROCESS FROM ITS INTENDED OBJECTIVE. AND CAN CONSEQUENTLY LEAD TO FAILURE WITH ALL THE DANGERS CONSEQUENCES IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR FUTURE. SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING TODAY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEVELOPMENT, MODERNIZATION AND REFORM. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS A FORM OF DESTRUCTION AND WITH EVERY ACTIVIST -- DESTRUCTION WE ARE DRIVEN AWAY FROM OUR MODERNIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT. HERE I DID NOT ONLY ME MATERIAL DESTRUCTION. I RATHER MEAN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL, MOORE COULDN'T LAND BEHAVIORAL DESTRUCTION WHICH BECOMES DIFFICULT TO CORRECT AS TIME GOES BY AND WE SEE THE SAME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ENDORSE SUCH PRACTICES AND ARE GRADUALLY DEVELOPING DISRESPECT FOR STATE INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT THEY STAND FOR NATIONAL LEVEL. THIS WILL LEAD TO ATROPHY OF THE PATRIOTIC AND NATIONAL SENTIMENT, WHICH ARE CENTRAL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PROTECTION OF THE HOMELAND. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR ENEMIES WANT US TO DO AND THIS IS THE DIRECTION THEY WANT US TO TAKE TODAY WE HAVE GENERATION A GENERATION OF CHILDREN WHO GREW UP WITH THESE EVENTS ARE LEARNED THIS ORDER. LACK OF RESPECT FOR INSTITUTIONS, LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND HATRED FOR THE STATES. WE WILL NOT FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES A BIT LATER ON IN THE PRICE WILL BE HIGH. AND HERE I WANT TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS CHAOS HAS PRODUCED MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB SEEKERS ARE IMPROVED HOBLICK POSITIONS? HAS IT IMPROVED THE SECURITY FOR WHICH WE ENJOY IN PRIDE OURSELVES ON? THERE IS NO DEVELOPMENT OF THAT STABILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO REFORMS THROUGH DESTRUCTION, SABOTAGE OR CHAOS. LAWS AND DECISIONS MUST BE SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE ANY PROGRESS AND ISOLATION FROM THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD REBUILD WHAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND WE NEED TO CORRECT THE DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS OR ISOLATE THEM. ONLY THEN CAN WE PROCEED WITH DEVELOPMENT. ALL OF THE ABOVE IS CONCERNED WITH DIAGNOSIS. AFTER PRACTICE HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE BASED ON REALITY AND FROM A TALK ABOUT REALITY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE. THIS IS WHY I STARTED A LONG SERIES OF MEETINGS WHICH HAVE INCLUDED ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY FROM THE SYRIAN REGIONS. IN ORDER TO SEE THIS REALITY AND UNDERSTAND IT AS IT IS OR TO HAVE AS CLOSE AN IDEA AS POSSIBLE ABOUT REALITY FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HELPS US RAISE THE PRIORITIES OF STATE INSTITUTIONS IN LINE WITH THE PRIORITIES OF OUR CITIZENS. I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS DIRECTLY FOR THE CITIZENS AWAY FROM OTHER CHANNELS WHICH MIGHT DO SOME FILTERING OF INFORMATION. THEY MIGHT PASS INFORMATION BUT WITHOUT THE EMOTIONS INVOLVED AND THE RELATIONSHIPS OF GENE PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY FACTS AND INFORMATION. THEY THERE ARE EMOTIONS TOO. [APPLAUSE] I WANTED TO STAY IN THE FUTURE OF THESE READINGS. ACTUALLY, THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS SPEECH AND WHAT I'M SAYING TODAY IS BASED ON THE DIALOGUE I HAD WITH THE CITIZENS. AS I SAID I MET PEOPLE FROM ALL SECTIONS, DEMONSTRATORS AND NON-DEMONSTRATORS. IN FACT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THEM, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT MY YEARS IN MY OFFICIAL POSITION, DESPITE THE PAIN AND FRUSTRATION IN THE GENERAL ADVERSARIES SURROUNDING THESE MEETINGS I CAN SAY THAT THE VALUE FROM THEM WAS ASTONISHING. THE LOVE I FELT FROM THESE PEOPLE REPRESENTS MOST OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AND IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER FELT THAN ANY STAGE STAGE OF MY LIFE. I CERTAINLY RECIPROCATE THE LOVE OF THESE PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I CERTAINLY IF SHE ATE -- RECIPROCATE THE LOVE OF THESE PEOPLE AND THE LOVE OF EVERY SYRIAN CITIZEN WHO I DID NOT KNOW BUT HOPE TO MEET IN SIMILAR MEETINGS. BUT WHAT I HOPE MORE THAN THAT IS TO TURN THIS LOVE TO ACTION. THIS OF COURSE CAN HAPPEN WITH YOUR HELP. THESE MEETINGS WERE VERY USEFUL, FRANK, IN-DEPTH AND COMPREHENSIVE. THEY COVERED ALL THE SHOES WITHOUT EXCEPTION. SOME OF THESE ISSUES FOR LOCAL AT THE LEVEL OF THE CITY OR THE GOVERNOR AND. SOME WERE COUNTRYWIDE. MY PRIORITY WAS TO ISSUE A CLEAR BEARING ON THE LARGEST SECTORS OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE. AND PRESIDENTS OVER LOCAL ISSUES. IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE. THIS HAS EXPRESSED ANGER MIXED WITH LOVE IN A SENSE OF BLAME MIX WITH LOYALTY BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THEIR STATES HAD DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THEM BY ADOPTING CERTAIN POLICIES ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN CERTAIN PRACTICES. I SENSE THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING WAS MULTIFACETED. PART OF IT WAS RELATED TO SERVICES IN LIVING STANDARDS AND SOME RELATED TO UNDERMINING CITIZENS DIGNITY. IGNORING THEIR VIEWS OR EXCLUDING THEM FROM PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT TO AND SUBSTANCE. BUT I ALSO FELT THE LOVE OF THESE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN ME THE SINCERE -- SINCERITY AND STEADFASTNESS, STEADFASTNESS AND THE STRENGTH TO PROCEED WITH OUR POLITICAL -- AND RESISTANCE IN NONCOMPLIANCE. AS FOR CORRUPTION, I FELT THAT THERE'S A STRONG DESIRE TO ERADICATE IT AS THE MAJOR CAUSE FOR THE LACK OF JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR FEELINGS OF SINCERENESS, AND JUSTICE AND OPPRESSION. IN ADDITION TO THIS MORAL CONSEQUENCE ON SOCIETY, WHAT IS MORE DANGEROUS STILL ARE THE CASES OF UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION AMONG CITIZENS ON A NARROWMINDED RACIST. THIS ON ITS OWN IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR UNDERMINING THE MOST POWERFUL OF NATIONS. CORRUPTION IS THE RESULT OF -- THE SPREAD OF PATRONAGE AND NEPOTISM AND THE ABSENCE OF INSTITUTIONS WHICH MEANS THE ABSENCE OF PROTECTOR AND THE GUARANTEE YOUR OF NATIONAL FEELINGS WHICH ARE REPLACED BY NARROW FEELINGS OF IDENTITY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO START WORKING IMMEDIATELY IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONS BYPASSING DEVELOPED LEGISLATION AND PROVIDING THESE INSTITUTIONS WITH OFFICIALS CAPABLE OF RESPONSIBILITIES INSTEAD OF BEING BORNE BY THE POSITIONS THEY OCCUPY. [APPLAUSE] SUCCESS ONLY COMES WHEN WE FIND APPROPRIATE CHALLENGES THROUGH WHICH CITIZENS CAN PARTICIPATE IN PLAY A ROLE IN OVERSIGHT AND POINTING TO ERRORS AND FAILURES. REDUCE CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHER-LEVEL BAR WHEN HE TO FIND CHANNELS FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS AT LOWER LEVELS. THIS IS A TASK OF THE ANTICORRUPTION COMMISSION WHOSE MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY THE COMMITTEE JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE. THESE ARE NICE WORDS AND I'M NOT SUPPLEMENTING MYSELF HERE. [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT COMPLEMENTING MYSELF HERE, BUT THE QUESTION PRESENTS ITSELF AS TO HOW CAN THEY BE ACHIEVED? IT IS EASY TO SAY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, BUT PUTTING THESE WORDS INTO ACTION IS A DECISIVE FACTOR. AS I SAID, I AIMS THROUGH THESE MEETINGS TO HAVE A MORE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF REALITY, BUT I FOUND MYSELF AT THE HEART OF GENUINE NATIONAL DIALOGUE. NATIONAL DIALOGUE IS NOT RESTRICTED TO SPECIFIC ELITE. IT IS IS NOT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE OPPOSITION. NEITHER IS IT IS NECESSARILY LIMITED TO POLITICAL ISSUES. IT IS A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF SOCIETY ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES FACING THAT NATION. IF WE AS THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN BE GIVEN A CERTAIN SIDE AND THE OPPOSITION A CERTAIN SIDE IT IS TRUE OF THE COUNTRIES IN SOCIETY THE LARGEST SECTION OF SOCIETY IS THAT WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO EITHER. WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, BUT PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AND DRYING THE FUTURE FOR DECADES AND GENERATIONS TO COME BY NEGLECTING THE LARGEST SECTION OF THE PEOPLE. HENCE THE IDEA OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE WHICH STARTED RECENTLY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT I WAS PART OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE. NEVERTHELESS I CANNOT CLAIM TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IT BECAUSE IN THE END I'M ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL AND THOSE I MET WITH WERE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS AND THE COUNTRY INCLUDES TENS OF MILLIONS. HENCE, THE BASIC IDEA TO LAUNCH A NATIONAL DIALOGUE AND THE WIDEST SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL STAKEHOLDERS TAKE PART IN INSTITUTIONAL FORM. FOR THIS PURPOSE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN SET UP CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING THE PRINCIPLES AND MECHANISMS FOR ENSURING CONFERENCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE DIFFERENT ISSUES OF CONCERN TO SYRIA. AND ITS CITIZENS. THE DIALOGUE WILL ALLOW WAS NOW ON THE ONE HAND A DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED DRAFT LAWS AT THIS STAGE AND ON THE OTHER, PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW SERIOUS FEATURE IN A COMPREHENSIVE SENSE FOR FUTURE DECADES AND GENERATIONS AND HELP US ALL ARRIVE AT A IMMATURE VISION FOR THE FUTURE. IT WILL PUSH FORWARD THE POLITICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS IN OUR COUNTRY AND SO POLITICAL PARTIES CAN PLAY A WIDER ROLE IN PUBLIC LIFE AFTER A NEW PARTY LAW IS PASSED. A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT OF POSSIBLE FORMATS OF DIALOGUE AND ONE OF THE FIRST TASKS OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMITTEE IS TO CONSULT WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE BEST FORMAT WHICH ENABLES US TO ACCOMPLISH OF REFORM PROJECT WITH A SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME. AS I SAID IN MY MEETING WITH THE CABINET, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE TIED TO A TIMEFRAME AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ALL CALLING FOR A TIMEFRAME FOR EVERYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT. WE CAN SAY THEN THAT NATIONAL DIALOGUE IS A TITLE FOR THE NEWEST STAGE. PARDON ME FOR THE PRESENT STAGE. WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS IDEA WE THOUGHT THE DIALOGUE SHOULD BE AT THE GOVERNING LEVEL. I'VE NOTICED TO MY MEETINGS AT THE CITIZENS FROM DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS THAT THE ISSUES THEMSELVES ARE NOT LOOKED AT FROM THE SAME PERSPECTIVE. THE REASON BEING THE LARGE SOCIAL DIVERSITY WE HAVE IN SYRIA. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE POINTS OF CONVERGENCE, STILL THERE ARE DIFFERENCES TO SOME EXTENT. SO IN THE BEGINNING WE SAW -- THOUGHT IT COLLECTIVE DIALOGUE AS THE FIRST PHASE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT A CENTRAL DIALOGUE. THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE CENTRAL DIALOGUE WILL BE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO AGREEMENTS REACHED OR THE ISSUES AROUND WHICH THERE WAS A CONSENSUS IN IN THE DIALOGUE. HOWEVER, AFTER SETTING UP THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION AND IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE TIME NEEDED AND THE RESULT OF THE CONDITION SERIOUS GOING THROUGH, THEY THOUGHT OF STARTING DIRECTLY WITH CENTRAL DIALOGUE. THERE WERE QUESTIONS RAISED, WHICH HAVE NOW BECOME PART OF THE MANDATE OF THE COMMISSION. HE WANTS TO START THE DIALOGUE, WHO WANTS TO TAKE PART, WHAT IS THE CRITERIA, HOUSE TO -- WHO TAKES PART AND OTHER TECHNICAL DETAILS. AT THIS MOMENT THERE IS CONFUSION ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN CLAIMS ON TELEVISION ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION DOES NOT CONDUCT A DIALOGUE. IT RATHER SUPERVISES THE DIALOGUE. IT LAYS THE MECHANISMS AND IDENTIFIES THE TIMEFRAME. AFTER THE END OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH IS AGREED UPON IS REFERRED TO THE COMMISSION, PASSED BY THE PRESIDENT, BY THE PRESIDENT PARDON ME AND THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WHICH MEET CERTAIN MEASURES, THE STATE FOLLOWS UP ON THEM. IN ANY CASE THE COMMISSION DID NOT WANT TO HAVE MONOPOLY OVER SETTING THE CRITERIA. DECIDED TO HOLD A CONSULTED AT COUNCIL THAT MEETING IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO WHICH IT INVITES MORE THAN 100 PERSONALITIES FROM DIFFERENT SECTIONS -- MAX SECTORS OF THE SYRIAN SOCIETY IN ORDER TO CONSULT WITH THEM ABOUT THE CRITERIA AND THE MECHANISMS. AFTER THAT DIALOGUE STARTS IMMEDIATELY AND THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIES THE TIMEFRAME, ONE MONTH OR TWO MONTHS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS TO SIDE. THIS DIALOGUE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROCESS AND SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE THE WHOLE FUTURE OF SYRIA IF YOU WANTED TO SUCCEED SHOULD BE BASED ON THIS DIALOGUE IN WHICH ALL PARTS OF THE SYRIAN SPECTRUM TAKE PART. WE CANNOT EXPECT A VISION FROM THE STATE OR FROM THE GOVERNMENT. A FEW SCORES OF PEOPLE CANNOT PLAN FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THIS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE. AS TO THE URGENT NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF THE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE PUT -- BEEN PUT INTO IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE DIALOGUE. WE HAVE IT LISTED THE EMERGENCY LAW AND THE STATE SECURITY COURTS, STEPS WILL ENSURE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF RELEVANT AGENCIES IN A MANNER WHICH ENHANCES AND PROTECTS PEOPLE'S DIGNITY WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE COUNTRY SECURITY. WE ALSO PASSED A LAW REGULATING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH STRENGTHENS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPECTING VIEWS AND POSITIONS AND A FREE, PEACEFUL AND ORGANIZED MANNER AS A HEALTHY CONDITION WHICH HELPS THE STATE RECTIFY FAILURES AND CORRECT TRENDS. QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ARREST AND DETENTION. FOR SOME PEOPLE, DETENTION CONTINUES AFTER LISTING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. I BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER IN THE STATES, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES, DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY NOR THE MEANING OF LISTING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. HOWEVER WE STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT ANY CASE OF ARREST TAKES PLACE AFTER A PERMIT IS OBTAINED FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE'S A SPECIFIC PERIOD ALLOWED FOR INVESTIGATIONS. IF THEY WANT TO EXTEND THIS. FACT THEY SHOULD OBTAIN A PERMIT THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. BUT THERE'S A SPECIFIC TIME LIMIT. WHEN SOMEBODY IS CAUGHT RED-HANDED THERE IS NO NEED FOR A PERMIT BUT THE SAME PROCEDURES ARE FOLLOWED WITH THE PERMIT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOWEVER LISTING THE STATE OF -- DOES NOT MEAN VIOLATING THE LAW. LISTING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGAL PUNISHMENT OR THE NATURE OF THESE PUNISHMENTS. BASED ON OUR CONVICTIONS, THE CITIZEN SHOULD BE BETTER REPRESENTED AND ELECTED INSTITUTIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS COUNCIL. A COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO DRAFT A NEW ELECTIONS LAW. THIS WILL TRANSCEND THE ROLE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS THE PUBLIC THAT ENABLE THEM TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN ENSURE WIDER PARTICIPATION. DISCIPLINE AS THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE, EQUALITY INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY. THESE PRINCIPLES WILL BE THE HALLMARK OF THE FUTURE WHICH WE SEEK FOR OUR COUNTRY. THIS ISSUE IS NOW SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THE COMMITTEE HAS FINISHED A DRAFT LAW TO BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO BE IN TORT LAW BECAUSE MOST OF THE CITIZENS I HEARD FROM THE CITIZENS REVOLVES AROUND THESE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE DIFFERENT COUNCILS. THIS LAW WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO CITIZENS TO ELECT PEOPLE WHO WILL REPRESENT THEM AND REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS. ANOTHER COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO DRAFT LEGISLATION AND DESIGNED THE NECESSARY MECHANISM FOR FIGHTING CORRUPTION. I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS CONCLUDED ITS WORK YESTERDAY PROPOSED A DRAFT LAW WHICH IS NOW SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THE ANTICORRUPTION COMMISSION HAS LIFTED UP IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT AND TURN IT INTO A NON-WANTED EXCEPTION RATHER THAN A WIDESPREAD PHENOMENON OR A REALITY. THE CITIZENS WILL PLAY A WIDE ROLE IN OVERSIGHT EFFORTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS. NO SUCCESS CAN BE ACHIEVED IN ERADICATING THIS EPIDEMIC WITHOUT THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF ALL CITIZENS. THE MEDIA PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD SO THEY SHOULD BE THE EYES AND THE VOICES OF THE CITIZENS AND WE HAVE STARTED A LARGE WORKSHOP IN ORDER TO MODERNIZE THE MEDIA, EXPAND THE SCOPE OF FREEDOM AND STRENGTHEN ITS RESPONSIBILITY SO THEY BECOME A TRANSPARENT MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND THE STATE. THIS LAW WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCUSSION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AND INCORPORATE FEEDBACK. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAS UNTIL JULY 24 TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. AFTER THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION LAWS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO DRAFT AND HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED I BELIEVE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS SOLD BE TAKEN IN THE TERM OF ITS IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT OR IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS. IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WHICH CANNOT BE SOLVED UNDER THE PRESENT CENTRAL OF ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL REGULATE THE AUTHORITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OLD ADMINISTRATION AND WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE GENERAL PERFORMANCE AND CONSEQUENTLY ON THE CITIZENS. ALSO SYRIAN NATIONALITY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO CITIZENS, REGISTERED PREVIOUSLY AS FOREIGNERS. THIS ONE HANDS NATIONAL UNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO MORE STABILITY IN THE LONG-TERM. THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 36,000 APPLICATIONS SO FAR AND THE NUMBER OF IDENTITY CARDS GIVEN SO FAR IS OVER 6700. SETTING UP A COMMITTEE TO SET A NEW PARTY LAW WAS A MATE OR STEP FOR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN WIDENING THE SCOPE OF DEMOCRATIC LIFE. A NEW PARTY LAW WILL ENRICH PARTY DIVERSITY AND ALLOW FOR MORE PARTICIPATION OR -- THIS POLITICAL TACTIC WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED WILL CREATE A NEW FISCAL REALITY AND SYRIA THROUGH BROADENING POPULAR PRECIPITATION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE AND MAKE CITIZENS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DECISION-MAKING, OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY WILL LEAD TO DEEP TRANSFORMATION SET THE LEVEL OF LYRICAL DYNAMISM AND ACTIVITY. THIS WILL ALSO LEAD TO -- THE PRINCIPLES OF CLINICAL ACTIVITY IN THE COUNTRY AND CONSEQUENTLY MAKE IT NECESSARY TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO EITHER AMEND IT, SOME OF IT -- MAKE ITS ARTICLES OR MAKE A NEW CONSTITUTION TO MAKE LEGAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES IN SYRIA. DURING THE PAST FOUR DECADES SINCE IT WAS PASSED. THIS PACKAGE WILL BE PRESENTED FOR A NATIONAL DIALOGUE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POINTED ME TO BE MENTIONED REGARDING THIS PACKAGE. [APPLAUSE] SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF REPRESSIVE NATION ON THE PART OF THE STATE FOR REFORM. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY IMPLY THAT THE STATE IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS REFORM. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THE REFORM PROCESS FOR US AS A MATTER OF COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE CONVICTION BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY AND BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES THE DESIRE OF THE PEOPLE. NO REASONABLE PERSON CAN OPPOSE THE PEOPLE OR THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO REFORM. THERE IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN PUT TO ME. I PERSONALLY HAVE NOT MET ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATE WHO OPPOSES REFORM. EVERYBODY IS ENTHUSIASTIC FOR REFORM. THE PROBLEM HOWEVER IS WHAT REFORM DO WE WANT? WHAT ARE THE DETAILS? THE PACKAGE OF LAWS WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED CONSISTS OF LAWS IN THE GENERAL SENSE BUT WHAT ARE THE DETAILS WHICH WE WANT IN WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE USEFUL? SOME PEOPLE EXPECT THAT THE LAWS PASSED IN THE PRESIDENT SIGNS IT SO IT IS EASY. CAN THIS HAPPEN? OF COURSE. DOES THIS LEAD TO POSITIVE REPORT -- RESULTS? MAY BE. WHEN I SAY MAYBE I MEAN THAT ALL POSSIBILITIES ARE THERE. WE CANNOT DO SOMETHING CRUCIAL AND CARRY OUT A FULL REFORM PROCESS AFTER 50 YEARS OF A CERTAIN POLITICAL STRUCTURE AND MOVE FORWARD RIGHT LEAPING INTO THE UNKNOWN. WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING AND WHAT TO EXPECT. WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? PARDON ME, WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS MAKING OUR FUTURE AND MAKING THE FUTURE IS A SOURCE OF HISTORY. THE HISTORY OR THE FUTURE WHICH WE ARE MAKING, WILL AFFECT FUTURE GENERATIONS FOR DECADES TO COME. EVEN IF WE MAKE AMENDMENTS IN LINE WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE FUTURE, STILL WHAT WE DO NOW IS SOMETHING OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE WHICH WILL AFFECT SYRIA'S FUTURE. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT AS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION AND HENCE THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE. WE NEED THE BROADEST POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION IN ORDER TO HAVE A WIDER TAKE ON THINGS AND TO HAVE A FAR-REACHING IMPACT INTO THE FUTURE. WHEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THE PRESIDENT SHOULD LEAD THE REFORM PROCESS THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE PRESIDENT CAN STAND AND REPLACE THE PEOPLE AND CARRY OUT THE REFORM PROCESS ON HIS OWN. LEADERSHIP DOES NOT MEAN ONE INDIVIDUAL STANDALONE BUT RATHER THAT HE SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE PROCEED WITH HIM. LEADERSHIP OF -- IS A PROCESS OF DIRECTION AND HERE I REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD FOCUS ON? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ELECTION LAW IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SYRIA? DO WE WANT SMALL CONSTITUENCIES, AND MEDIUM-SIZE CONSTITUENCIES OR LARGE-SIZE CONSTITUENCIES? EVERY OPTION HAS GOT ITS QUALITATIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECT. WHICH ELECTION LAW ACHIEVES BOLLINGER GRATION DOES NOT LEAD TO FRAGMENTATION? WHICH ELECTION LIVES BETTER SUITED TO THE NEW PARTY LAW WHICH WE WANT? WHAT IS THE PARTY LAW WHICH LEADS TO FULL INTEGRATION OF SYRIAN SOCIETY AND PRESERVE SERIOUS UNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME PREVENT SYRIA FROM TURNING INTO A BALL RATHER THAN A PLAYER AS IT USED TO BE DECADES AGO? THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS WHICH NEED TO BE RAISED. AS TO THE ELECTION LAW, DO WE WANT TO ELECT AN INDIVIDUAL OR A PROGRAM? THERE ARE QUESTIONS AND SO FAR WE DO NOT HAVE ANSWERS. EVEN IF WE HAVE AN ANSWER, WE SHOULD NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT ANSWER AND PROCEED CARRYING OUT THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TOGETHER. WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF AWARENESS AND THE QUESTION IS THAT OF DISCUSSION. SO WE NEED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AND THESE ARE ONLY SAMPLES OF A LARGE FRIDAY OF QUESTIONS. THERE ARE OTHERS. DULY PASSED A PARTY LAW AND ELECTION LAW BEFORE THE ELECTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY? THE MAJORITY SAYS YES. SOME PEOPLE WANT US TO SEPARATE THE ELECTIONS LAW FROM THE PARTY LAW AND WANT THE NEW ASSEMBLY TO PASS THE PARTY LOVE. DO WE WANT TO POSTPONE THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY FOR THREE MONTHS AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE PROPOSED, OR DO WE HAVE THEM ON TIME? AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED WE DO NOT WANT TO ADOPT A CERTAIN ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS. WE WANT TO BE IMPARTIAL AS A STATE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS PUBLIC CONSENSUS. THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THESE AND OTHER ISSUES, WE WILL HAVE A BIG PROBLEM IN SYRIA. AS TO THE CONSTITUTION, THIS IS A SLIGHTLY SEPARATE QUESTION. DO WE REPLACE A FEW ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDING ARTICLE VIII OR DO WE CHANGE THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO? IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO COME BENGE MACK CHANGE A COMPLETELY. SOME PEOPLE SUGGEST WE HAD TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS NOW AND AMEND SOME ARTICLES AND LATER ON MAKE REVISION OF THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION. AND SOME ARTICLES NEED TO BE AMENDED, THEN THEY SHOULD BE AMENDED BY THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY. IF WHAT IS NEEDED IS CHANGING THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION, THIS BEATS A PUBLIC REFERENDUM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MAIN QUESTION -- PARDON ME BUT THE MAIN QUESTION IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK. I CAN RAISE THEM WITHOUT GIVING A TIMEFRAME BUT IF WE GIVE A TIMEFRAME, EVEN IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THESE QUESTIONS. IS COMMITTEES HAVE COMPLETED THEIR WORK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MEDIA COMMITTEE WHICH WILL COMPLETE ITS WORK IN JULY, THE PARTY LAW COMMITTEE WILL FINISH IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. FULLY COMPLETE THE PARTY AND ELECTION LAW THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL REFORM AND WE CAN THEN START THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE DIRECTLY AND DISCUSS ALL THESE LAWS AND THE LAWS WHICH WILL BE PASSED LATER. CONCERNING NATIONAL DIALOGUE, I DID NOT WANT TO SET A TIMEFRAME ON THEIR BEHALF BUT SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED SUGGESTS A MONTH AND OTHER SUGGESTED TWO MONTHS. IN ANY CASE IF THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS ARE NOT POSTPONED THEY WILL BE HELD IN AUGUST AND WE WILL HAVE IN THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY IN AUGUST. WE CAN SAY THAT WE CAN COMPLETE THIS PACKAGE BY THE END OF AUGUST, BY THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER ALL THIS PACKAGE WILL BE COMPLETED. THE CONSTITUTION IS A -- IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT NEEDS THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY. WITH IF THE NEW PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY IS ELECTED IN AUGUST THEY CAN DIRECTLY START STUDYING THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. IF THEY ARE POSTPONED AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TAKEN A PROCESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE FOR A FEW MONTHS THE PACKAGE WILL BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. MEANING IN FIVE MONTHS. HOWEVER, IF WE WANT TO HAVE A FULL REVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION HAD TO HAVE A NEW ONE, THE PROCESS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. THEN WE SHOULD HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WHICH PROPOSES THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE PUBLIC REFERENDUM, BUT WHAT WE WOULD DO IMMEDIATELY IS TO SET UP A COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME. THE COMMITTEE WILL START ITS WORK IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WE WILL GIVE IT A MONTH, WHICH I THINK IS SUFFICIENT. IT WILL PREFER IT STUDIES TO A NATIONAL DIALOGUE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A CLEAR TIMEFRAME. LET'S SAY THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER OR FIVE MONTHS UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. BUT WE ARE MOVING AHEAD WITH ALL THE FLAWS AND STUDYING THE CONSTITUTION WHICH WILL BE THE LAST DAYS. A LOT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE DELAYS IN REFORM. I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY AND SAID THAT WE ARE A BIT LATE. SOME PEOPLE STARTED TO ASK WHY THEY WERE LAID. THERE IS NO -- I SAID THAT WE WERE LATE BUT I DID NOT SAY WE HAD STOPPED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE LAWS ARE LISTING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS READY ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO AND THE DRAFT PARTY LAW WAS ALSO READY ABOUT A YEAR AGO. WE STARTED PREPARING THE LOCAL OF ADMINISTRATION LOVE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. THE REASON WHY WE HAVE NOT PASSED THE FIRST AND SECOND LAWS IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION LAW WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE REFORM PROCESS, HAS TWO ASPECTS TO IT, ELECTIONS AND PARTICIPATION. GETTING TO THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION LAW IN ANY CASE REQUIRES AMENDING THE ELECTION LAW, SO AS A MATTER OF PRIORITIES WE DID NOT NEGLECT THE OTHER LAWS. WE LOOKED AT PRIORITIES THAN IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM WHAT WE LOOK AT THEM RIGHT NOW. AMIDST THIS HUGE WORKSHOP OF REFORM, LAWS AND DIALOGUE WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVING PROBLEMS OF THE SYRIAN CITIZENS WHICH REMAINED MORE URGENT. THE GOVERNMENT PASS A NUMBER DECISIONS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVING -- IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARDS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS WAS TO REDUCE DIESEL PRICES FROM ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT DEMANDS MADE BY ALL THE DELEGATIONS WHICH I MET WITH WITHOUT EXCEPTION. I HOPE THAT ITS IMPACT ON THE LIVING STANDARDS WILL BE FELT IN THE NEAR FUTURE PARTICULARLY AMONG THE POORER SECTIONS OF THE SYRIAN SOCIETY. WE ALSO WORKED ON REDUCING CONSTRUCTION COSTS THROUGH RECONSIDERING WITH ENGINEER SOCIETY THE RELATED FEES IN ORDER TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON CITIZENS TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE AND RESOURCES ALLOW. WE HOPE THE GENERAL REDUCTION OF COSTS WILL PUSH THE ECONOMY FORWARD, INCREASE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPENSATE THE LARGE LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE SYRIAN ECONOMY DURING THE CURRENT EVENTS. THEY WOULD INCREASE THE SUFFERING OF THE CITIZENS IF WE DID NOT FACE THEM WITH THE RAPID PROCEDURES THAT MITIGATE THE PRESSURE AT AT THE PRESIDENT REVERSED OBSTRUCTION LATER ON. THIS IS A GROUP OF MEASURES AIMED AT ALLEVIATING THE CRISIS AND REDUCING BURDENS ON SYRIAN CITIZENS. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS FOR ALL OF US TO WORK IN ORDER TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYRIAN ECONOMY. THE MOST DANGEROUS THING WE WILL FACE IS THE WEAKNESS OR THE COLLAPSE OF THE SYRIAN ECONOMY. A LARGE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW FOR FEAR OR FRUSTRATION TO DEFEAT US. WE SHOULD DEFEAT THE PROBLEM BY RETURNING TO A NORMAL LIFE, RETURNING TO NORMALCY HAS A MORAL IMPACT OF THE ECONOMY IS AFFECTED BY THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE POPULATION. WE SHOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL LIFE AS FAR -- AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THE CRISIS MIGHT GIVE US A BLOODY NOSE, MIGHT GIVE US PAIN, MIGHT SHEIKH US, MIGHT THROW US ON THE GROUND BUT WE SHOULD NOT -- BUT WE SHOULD RISE AGAIN STRONGER AND MORE TENACIOUS IN ORDER TO CARRY ON OUR LIVES NORMALLY. [APPLAUSE] HERE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE CITIZENS WHO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THE CAMPAIGN TO SUPPORT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LESS THAN A THOUSAND YET THEY CONTRIBUTED. [APPLAUSE] SOME HAVE THOUSANDS AND THEY DID THE SAME THING. ONE DAY AFTER WE OVERCOME THE CRISIS WE SHOULD ASK ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE MONEY ABOUT THE ROLE THEY PLAY, HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CAMPAIGN. THIS IS A NATIONAL DUTY. [APPLAUSE] ADMINISTRATED DEVELOPMENT REMAINS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN THE WORK OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE WILL PROCEED IN OUR PLAN BY REGULATING AUTHORITIES AND CONTROLLING PRACTICES IN ORDER TO PREVENT OVERLAPPING IN THE WORK OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ARE IN OR IN THE WORK OF INDIVIDUALS TO OUTSIDE THE STATES. WE SHOULD ALSO ADOPT SOUND CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING PERSONNEL AND ACCEPTING PERFORMANCE. IN OTHER WORDS WE SHOULD PREVENT NEPOTISM. MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND SO FAR ABOUT 120 MISSIONS CLEARANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN PART OF THE YOUR CREDIT PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WORK OF THE SECURITY SYSTEM HAS BEEN RECENTLY SEPARATED FROM THE WORK OF CIVIL INSTITUTIONS. WE NEED TO RELY MORE ON INSPECTION, FIDUCIARY FINANCIAL CONTROL AND THE ANTICORRUPTION COMMISSION AND ITS NEW FORMAT. THE MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO OVERSIGHT BY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY TO GOVERNMENT WORK AND TO CONSTITUTE A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THE CITIZENS ARE GOING ADDITION TO OTHER CHANNELS BETWEEN STATE OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS. EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE ORGANIZATIONS AND TRADE UNIONS WHICH REPRESENT THEIR INTEREST. WE SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE ECONOMIC ISSUES AND WE NEED TO LOOK FOR A NEW ECONOMIC MODEL. IN THE PAST THERE WERE TWO MODELS, THE SOCIALIST MODEL IN THE S. MODEL. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THESE MODELS HAVE FALLEN. NOW, WE DO NOT HAVE READY MADE EXPERIENCES TO TAKE AND IMPLEMENT. WAY TO LOOK FOR A MODEL WITH SYRIA. THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN NOW HAVE TO DO WITH DEALING WITH THE MEDIA AND DEALING WITH SUFFERING. IN OTHER WORDS THEY DEAL WITH TEMPORARY PROBLEMS THAT DO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN. IF WE DO NOT KNOW THE MODEL FOR SYRIA WHICH ACHIEVE SOCIAL THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR, THE COUNTRY AND THE CITY, WE WILL HAVE A PROBLEM. ECOSPHERE IS ALREADY A BIG PROBLEM IN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE COUNTRY IN AND THE CITY, DESPITE THE BALANCED ECONOMIC POLICY WHICH SYRIA HAS FOLLOWED IN TERMS OF PROVIDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE AND RELYING ON THE LOCAL RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE NEEDS NATIONAL DIALOGUE ON THE ECONOMY, SOMETHING WILL DO LATER IN ORDER TO MOVE AHEAD IN THIS FIELD. THESE ARE SOME BASIC TITLES FOR THE NEXT PHASE. THESE TITLES ARE THE AXIS AROUND WHICH, WITH ANY OTHER. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ONE SINGLE SPEECH WOULD NOT ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES. THEREFORE THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE WILL BE THE METHOD THROUGH WHICH ANY ISSUE THAT ENRICHES WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MY SPEECH OR MORE THAN THAT CAN BE RAISED. THE NEXT PHASE IS A STAGE OF TURNING SYRIA INTO CONSTRUCTION SITES TO COMPENSATE FOR TIME AND DAMAGES AND TO RECTIFY RISKS AND HEAL WOUNDS. WHEN THE BLOOD OF ANY SYRIAN CITIZEN WHOEVER HE IS AND WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS FELT THIS MEANS THE ENTIRE NATION IS BLEEDING. A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN. SITTING ON THE FENCE HOWEVER IS DEEPENING THE ONES. WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY OF THE NATION REGARDLESS OF OUR POSITIONS AND VIEWS. WE WILL PROSECUTE AND HOLD RESPONSIBLE ANYONE WHO -- OR STARTS TO DO SO. THE DELAY PROCEDURES FOR BUREAUCRATIC REASONS IS NOT BEING PROGRESSIVE NATION AND IS NOT MEAN THE DAMAGE THAT HAPPENS IMPACTED EVERYONE. AND BRING ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE TO ACCOUNT IS THE RIGHT OF THE STATE AS MUCH AS IT IS A RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS. THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE IS PROCEEDING WITH HIS WORK WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION. IS FULL IMMUNITY IN INDEPENDENTS. I FOLLOW UP THEIR WORK FROM TIME TO TIME. DOES NOT WORK ACCORDING TO POLITICAL CRITERIA. IT WORKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGAL CRITERIA, WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CONSTANTLY GO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO INVITE ANY INDIVIDUAL. SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING AT. THIS IS NOT TRUE. IT HAS ARRESTED A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS AND THEY ARE COMPLETING THEIR INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO BRING THEM TO JUSTICE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. WE ENFORCE THE LAW THIS IS NOT MEAN REVENGE IN ANY WAY AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW WITHOUT KILLING OR DESTRUCTION. THE STATE IS LIKE A MOTHER OR FATHER WHO EMBRACES EVERYONE AND ACCOMMODATES ALL HER CHILDREN. THE STATE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IS BASED ON TOLERANCE AND LOVE, NOT ON HATRED AND REVENGE. AND WHEN THE STATE FORGIVES THOSE WHO MAKE MISTAKES, GET AIMS AT ENSHRINING THIS ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CITIZENS. BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT -- WHEN IT COMES TO HARMING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT SOME DEMONSTRATORS CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATED IN THE PAST AND BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED BY THE STATE. WE ANNOUNCE AMNESTY TO ALL THOSE WHO TURNED THEMSELVES ENDURING THE MONTH OF APRIL AND MAY. THEY WERE PARDONED IMMEDIATELY. AND AS I SAY TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE, TRY TO CONTACT THE STATE AND YOU WILL FIND A POSITIVE RESPONSE AND TOLERANCE ON THE PART OF THE STATE'S INSTITUTIONS EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE CARRIED WEAPONS AND IT NOT TO USE THEM ANYONE. HOWEVER, AS FOR TERRORIZING CITIZENS AND COMMITTING ACTS OF KILLING AND TERRORISM, THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE AND THEY STAYED DOES NOT ENFORCE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, I CALLED ON ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT THE CITY OR VILLAGE IS TO RETURN. THE RETURN OF THE DISPLACED IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE THE CITY DIES WITHOUT ITS PEOPLE. WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT NORMAL LIFE AND ECONOMIC LIFE WHILE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND HAVE GONE TO OTHER AREAS. I CALL ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND EVERY FAMILY WHO LEFT THE CITY OR VILLAGE TO RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I STRESS THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT CALLS ON ALL OF THOSE WHO LEFT THE VILLAGES SURROUNDING TURKEY TO RETURN IMMEDIATELY, RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES IMMEDIATELY. THERE ARE THOSE WHO TELL THEM OR SUGGEST TO THEM THAT THE STATES ARE IMPLYING THE STATES WILL TAKE REVENGE AGAINST THEM. I ASSURE THEM THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE. THE ARMIES THERE FOR THEIR SECURITY AND THE SECURITY OF THEIR CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] SO WE HOPE TO SEE THEM SOON. EVERY INDIVIDUAL MIGHT ASK HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE? I WANT TO DO SOMETHING. HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM? OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE NOW. I SAY THAT THERE IS A ROLE THAT THE PEOPLE CAN PLAY AND THE THE ROLE THAT THE GUESS THEY CAN PLAY. THE STATE PLAYS ITS ROLE THROUGH THE REFORMS I TALKED ABOUT, POLITICAL REFORM, ECONOMIC REFORM AND REFORM IN OTHER AREAS. THE STATES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN PROVIDING SERVICES. IT MUST PROVIDE SERVICES. THERE ARE MEASURES WHICH HAVE HARMED THE CITIZENS. THE STATE SHOULD RECTIFY THESE DEFICIENCIES. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ACTS OF KILLING TARA STATION AND STATION AND DESTRUCTION WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND PROSECUTED. IT IS A DUTY OF THE STATES TO PROSECUTE THEM. IN THIS REGARD SOME PEOPLE DEBATE WHETHER THE THIS SOLUTION SHOULD BE POLITICAL OR SECURITY-BASED. THEY SAY THAT THE SECURITY-BASED SOLUTION HAS FAILED AND CONSUL RALLY THE STATE SHOULD PROCEED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POLITICAL SOLUTION. IN FACT, WE IN THE STATE THINK THIS SOLUTION SHOULD BE POLITICAL. THE PROBLEM CONSISTS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEMANDS BUT WHAT IDENTIFIES THE METHOD OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE STATES YOU BUT THEN A TRIP THE PROBLEM ITSELF. IT IS NOT THE STATE WHICH WANTS A DESIRE TO FORCE THOSE INVOLVED IN ACTS OF DESTRUCTION. THIS IS NOT REASONABLE. THERE IS NO POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO CARRY WEAPONS AND KILL. WE WANT A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND WE WANT THE ARMY TO GO BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT SECURITY PERSONNEL TO GO BACK TO THEIR OFFICES, AND POSITION. THE NORMAL THING IS FOR CITIZENS TO DEAL WITH THE POLICE AND THE JUDICIARY. CITIZENS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ARMY OR THE SECURITY PERSONNEL. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE POLICE FORCES IN SYRIA ARE STRONG AND THE POLICE HAVE NOT AND TRAINED FOR SUCH CASES. WE STARTED RECRUITMENT BUT THE CAPACITY IS LIMITED. AT THE SAME TIME, TRAINING TAKES A LONG TIME. IN ANY CASE AND REGARDLESS OF THE CRISIS, WE WANT TO REGULATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITIZEN OF THE THE END THE STATE AND THE DIRECTION. THIS TAKES SOME TIME. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT REFORM. PARDON ME, WE WANT THEM TO SUPPORT REFORM AND THIS IS SELF-EVIDENT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING REFORM. IT IS ONLY NATURAL FOR THEM TO SUPPORT REFORM IS SUPPORTING REFORM TAKES PLACE FIVE DISTINGUISH THEM BETWEEN REAL REFORMISTS AND THOSE INVOLVED IN DESTRUCTION AND SABOTAGE. AND ALSO ISOLATING THOSE WHO WANT TO WRITE THE WAY OF REFORM IN ORDER TO MAKE PERSONAL GAIN. WE WANT THEM TO PREVENT CHAOS. AS I SAID THOUGH THERE ARE THOSE WHO -- PARENTS WITH CHILDREN, BOB BROTHERS AND A PROCESS OF AWARENESS RAISING. WE WANT THE DEMONSTRATION TO BE TURNED INTO WRITTEN OPINIONS, TO IDEAS, TO DIALOGUE, TO ASK ON THE GROUND. NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THEORETICAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT -- I'M RATHER TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING PRACTICAL. IN SOME PLACES AS SECURITY FORCES WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION STARTED TO WORK WITH THE STATES ON THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. IN CITING CORRUPTION OR TO PRESERVE THE SECURITY OF THE VILLAGES AND THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVED. THIS OF COURSE REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF CHANNELS BETWEEN THESE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WHEN WE CREATED THESE CHANNELS THEY TURNED SOME DEMONSTRATORS INTO INDIVIDUALS WHO WANTED TO BUILD A COUNTRY. A DEMONSTRATION IS AN EXPRESSION OF PAIN, OF SUFFERING THAT THE STATE HAS NOT RESPONDED TO. WHEN THE STATES RESPOND TO THE SITUATION BECAME COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THOSE CHANNELS IN ORDER TO TURN EVERY INDIVIDUAL INTO A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN. THIS IS OF COURSE A TEMPORARY PHASE AND SOME POLITICAL PARTIES STARTED TO PLAY THE ROLE IN THE FUTURE. SO PARTIES ARE A NATURAL PARTY FOR TRANSFORMING INTO ACTION ON THE GROUND AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE RETURN OF NORMAL LIFE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. EVEN IF THE CRISIS GOES ON FOR MONTHS OR YEARS WE SHOULD ACCOMMODATE AND ACCLIMATE OURSELVES TO IT. WE SHOULD CORNERED AND MAKE IT LIMITED TO THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CRISIS. NOW WE HAVE AN ARMY THERE AND UNTIL THE ARMY RETURNED TO THEIR BARRACKS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS ARMY AND ASK FOR HIS SUPPORT EVERYWHERE. THE ARMY CONSISTS OF THE BROTHERS OF EVERY SYRIAN CITIZEN AND THE ARMY ALWAYS STAND FOR HONOR AND DIGNITY. [APPLAUSE] YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS STAGE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE AN ACTIVE POWER. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS AN ELECTRONIC WHICH HAS BEEN A REAL ARMY AND VIRTUAL-REALITY. THERE ARE THOSE WHO -- AND OTHER NATIONS. I MET A NUMBER OF YOUTH DELEGATIONS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIETIES. YOUTH I MEAN YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ALSO. AND I HAVE MET MANY YOUTH DELEGATIONS FROM SUCH THERE'S TOURS OF SOCIETY AND FOUND THEM TO HAVE A HIGH SENSE OF PATRIOTISM AND THIS IS SELF-EVIDENT BECAUSE THEY BELONG TO THIS COUNTRY. THIS GENERATION HAS TO PREPARE ITSELF FOR THE NEXT POLITICAL FACE IT WE CAN BECOME THE MODEL OF THE WHOLE REGION AND IT SAID THAT TAKING LESSONS FROM OTHERS WE SHOULD TEACH THEM. [APPLAUSE] IN THE SPEECH I TOUCH ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POINTS. AND MET A LARGE NUMBER OF DELEGATIONS AND I THE LIST OF ISSUES WHICH NUMBER OVER 1000 BIG AND SMALL ISSUES. AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE I AM MET WITH WHERE SHOULD I RAISE THE ISSUE THEY HAVE TOUCHED ON? FOR EVERYONE BELIEVES THAT THIS ISSUE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. I MENTIONED THESE ISSUES NOT BECAUSE THEY INCOME PUTS ALL HER PROBLEMS, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE. AS FOR THE OTHER ISSUES, WE ARE IN -- ADDRESSING THEM CONTINUOUSLY. THE MEETINGS WITH PUBLIC DELEGATIONS HAVE ALLOWED ME TO EXPAND THE DIRECT CHALLENGE WHICH EXIST BETWEEN ME AND THE CITIZENS. THESE CHANNELS HAVE A RICH SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND WHAT IS ANY OFFICIAL MEETS. IN THE NEXT BETA WILL CONTINUE HOLDING SUCH MEETINGS WHICH IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING CONFIDENCE WHICH OUR INTERNAL POLICIES WILL BE BUILT. THE SAME GOES FOR FOREIGN POLICY WHICH I SAW SOUGHT TO BASE ON THE PULSE OF THE STREET AND REFLECT AND EVERY SITUATION WE FACE. THIS POPULAR -- WHICH IS DOES NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING SHORT OF SYRIA AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE BOTH ON ITS LAND AND ITS DECISIONS. THIS POPULAR POLLS WHICH REFUSES TO LET THE HOMELAND BE A PLAYER ON ITS OWN COURT. THIS REFUSES TO ALLOW HIS ROLE TO BE MEASURED ACCORDING TO ITS GEOGRAPHICAL SIZE RATHER THAN ITS HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE. OTHERWISE SERIO WILL BE -- WITH ITS OWN BORDERS RATHER THAN REACHING OUT TO VITAL REGIONAL DIMENSIONS AND THUS TURN INTO A STATE OF BUYABLE TRIBES FROM OUTSIDE THE BORDERS. THROUGH ALL OF THAT WE MUST REALIZE THAT ACHIEVING REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT DOES NOT ONLY REPRESENT INTERNAL NEEDS BUT IT IS NECESSARY AND VITAL TO CONFRONT THOSE PLANS AND THEREFORE WE HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO SUCCEED IN THE DOMESTIC PROJECT IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN OUR EXTERNAL PROJECT. OR PRESSURES ARE DIRECTED AGAINST SERIOUS ROLE IN RESISTING THE THEMES OF SECTARIAN DIVISION AND THE REGION WHICH WILL MEAN THAT THERE IS NEITHER RESISTANCE NOR RIGHTS BUT COLLAPSE AND SURRENDER. ACCOMPISHING SECURITY AS THEIR STARTING POINT AND THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST CAPABLE TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH MAINTAINING SECURITY AND PROTECTING THE HOMELAND. HOMELAND. I AM SAYING THIS BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND REALITY NOT OUT OF COURTESY. THOSE WHO PROTECTED THE COUNTRY THROUGH HARD TIMES AND THOSE WHO PROTECTED IT TODAY ARE PEOPLE. OUR PEOPLE. THE YOUNG PEOPLE CONFRONTED DANGERS, MADE INITIATIVES AND IMPLEMENTED THINGS ON THE GROUND. FORMING POPULAR COMMITTEES AND YOUTH GROUPS MAKING PERSONAL MISCHIEF WHICH KEPT THE COUNTRY'S NAME HINE REFLECTED ITS FEARS IN THE POLLS OF ITS VIEWS AND PEOPLE. .. IT IS DEEPLY ROOTED VALUES AND DETERMINATION OF PETE OF WHO AREN'T ADEQUATE INTELLIGENCE OF A CIVILIZATION OF IT IS HE WHO PREVENTED THE CONFUSION BETWEEN THE CREED AND SUPERPOWERS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE PEOPLE DESIRED REFORM AND CHANGE IN THE OTHER. THOSE WHO PROTECTED THE VIEWS FROM THE SACRIFICE TO INTERNATIONAL POWERS AS YOU PRESENTED ALL ATTEMPTS OF SECRETARY POSITION SCREAMING AT THE GATES OF THE HOMELAND AND THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE BEFORE IT COULD KILL IT. I SAY THAT IF I MISS YOU ENJOY THIS GREAT SPIRIT AND DEEP SENSE OF IDENTITY."
SYR_Doc9_Speech_Dom,"Peace be upon you, upon all those who are protecting this dear and precious homeland. Peace be upon the people, the army, the security forces and all those who have been working to insure the prevention of sedition; burying it in the detestable snake holes where it belongs. Peace be upon every mother who has lost a dear son, on every child who lost a father, on every family that lost a beloved one. Peace be upon the souls of our martyrs whose blood has grown into chrysanthemum in the spring and summer when the seasons of flowering and fruition have been replaced by seasons of conspiracy and killing. But even season of conspiracy gives flowers in Syria. They bloom into pride and impregnability. Today, and through you, I address every Syrian citizen throughout the homeland. I wanted to speak to you directly in order to strengthen the interaction and spontaneity that have characterized our relationship for years. I wish I had the chance meet every Syrian citizen in person, but I am convinced that meeting some of you on any occasion makes me feel that I am reaching out to all of you. Through you, I would like to send my greetings to every brother and sister, every young man and woman, every mother and father expressing adherence to their national unity, working hard in order to ensure the country's safety, while giving everything in their power in order for it to remain strong. It took me some time to address you, despite the fact that many of the Syrians I met recently urged me to speak sooner. It took me this time because I did not want to make my speech a platform for propaganda. I did not want to speak about what we ""will achieve"" but rather about what we ""have achieved"" or what is ""in-process of being achieved."" I wanted the substance of my speech to be based on what I heard and felt through my meetings with Syrian citizens throughout the past weeks. Credibility after all has been the foundation of my relationship with the Syrian people; a relationship built on deeds rather than words and on substance rather than form. This relationship was built on the basis of trust which grew through the meetings that we recently held. Although these meetings included relatively small groups, when compared to the larger Syrian population, they clearly established the greatness of our people who showed patriotic awareness, goodness, intelligence, and pride. Of course, delaying my speech until today gave rise to many rumors in the country-rumors that were heard by both you and I. Rumors, however, are not important. What's more important is time. Every day brought with it new information, and so did every meeting I held with the many popular delegations that I met. As a result of these rumors, however, every delegation wanted to check about me personally and how authentic or not these rumors actually were. I want to say that every rumor you heard about the President, his family, and his work is absolutely groundless. All of them, whether malicious or innocent, are untrue. Today we meet at an important juncture in the history of our nation. This is a moment in which, through our will and determination, we strive to make a point of departure from a past burdened with pain and unrest-where innocent blood, which has pained every single Syrian heart, was shed. We aim at a future full of hope; hope that our homeland will restore the harmony and tranquility that it always enjoyed, based on strong foundations of freedom, solidarity and engagement. We have been through difficult times. In terms of our security and stability, we have paid a heavy price. What happened was an unprecedented ordeal that overshadowed our country and led to a situation of distress, confusion, and frustration. This was due to riots, the killing of innocents, terrorizing the population, and sabotaging both public and private property. The Martyrs are great loss for their families, homeland, and for me A number of martyrs died and others were injured during these incidents, being ordinary citizens, security personnel, and the Armed Forces. That was a great loss to their families and loved ones, a great loss to the homeland, and an extremely heavy loss for me personally. I pray the Almighty God to have mercy on the souls of all martyrs, and offer my deep and heartfelt condolences to their families and relatives. In as much as we feel the loss and pain, we are prompted to contemplate this profound experience, both in its negative aspects, vis-a-vis the loss of life and property, and in its positive ones, in terms of the test it has constituted to all of us. We discovered our true national element with all its strength and solidity, on the one hand, and weaknesses on the other. Since turning the clock back is futile, our only option is to look forward. We took this option when deciding to shape the future, rather than standing by and letting the future shape us and the events around us. We have decided to control events rather than letting events control us-we will lead rather than be lead. This means that we should build upon rich experiences that have singled out deficiencies. In all this, we keep looking forward while taking a long hard look at the past in order to understand the present. It is only natural that the common question today is: What is happening to our country, and why? Is it a conspiracy, and if so, who stands behind it? Or is it our fault, and if so, what is this fault? And of course there are many natural questions during these circumstances. I do not think there is a stage in Syria's history where it was not the target of some sort of conspiracy, both before and after independence. Those conspiracies took place for many reasons, some relating directly to the important geopolitical position that Syria occupies. The solution is, for us, to solve our own problems Others were linked to its political positions, principles, and interests. Conspiracies are like germs, after all, multiplying every moment everywhere. They cannot be eliminated, but we can strengthen the immunity of our bodies in order to protect ourselves against them. It doesn't require much analysis, based on what we heard from others and witnessed in the media, to prove that there is indeed a conspiracy. We should not waste time discussing it or being frightened by it. Rather, we would to identify the internal weaknesses through which this conspiracy can infiltrate the country. Then we should work on correcting these weaknesses. The solution, at the end of the day, is for us to solve our own problems and to avoid ramifications that could weaken our national immunity. Germs exist everywhere, on the skin and within the guts. Throughout the history of scientific development, scientists always thought of ways to strengthen the immunity of our bodies. This is what we must think of because it is certainly more important than analyzing the conspiracy. I don't think that data will show all details anytime soon. Probably the truth will not emerge for years to come. Some, however, say that there is no conspiracy. This is also not objective, not only for the crisis, but for the circumstances and the historical context of Syria. External political positions, after all, are applying pressure on Syria and trying to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. Their target is a price that we know in advance, related directly to us abandoning our principles, rights, and interests. What do we say about these political positions? What do we say about all of this media pressure? What do we say about these sophisticated phones that are found in Syria in the hands of vandals? What do we say about all the fraud that we witnessed recently? We certainly cannot say that this was an act of charity. It is definitely a conspiracy, but again, we will not waste our time discussing it. I said this before in my speech before the People's Assembly and at the Cabinet: ""We must focus on domestics."" In today's speech I will only address the domestic situation, without referring to external factors, neither positively or negatively. What is happening on the street has three components. First are those who have demands or needs that they want the state to meet. I have previously spoken about rightful demands. This is one of the duties of the state towards its citizens; where it should work tirelessly in order to meet those demands to the best of its capacities. The urgent need of some people does not justify the spreading of chaos All of us, in our positions of responsibility should listen to them, talk to them, and help them, under the umbrella of public order. Law enforcement does not justify neglecting demands of the people. The urgent need of some people also does not justify the spreading of chaos, the breaking of laws, and harming of public interests. I met a large number of those who belong to this component. And when I say those who have needs, I do not mean the demonstrators in specific. I rather mean all those who have needs. Although some of them also have needs, they did not demonstrate, and yet, we need to deal with them as well. The delegations I met with were from all sectors of society and all religions as well. We need to differentiate between those people, and others who were involved in destruction. The latter are a small group. It is true that they made an impact; they tried to manipulate others. They tried to manipulate the good majority of the Syrian people in order to achieve different purposes. Differentiating between the two groups is very important. The first constitute a part of our national component and all of the demands I heard from them were raised underneath the national umbrella. They had no foreign agenda and no foreign connections. They were against any foreign intervention under any pretext, asking to engage, however, rather than be marginalized. They wanted justice. Many issues were raised. For instance, there are unsolved accumulated issues dating back three decades since confrontation with the Muslim Brotherhood. That was a black phase, and generations are still paying the price for that period, like being refused government employment, for example, or not being given security permissions. In other words, we held certain individuals responsible for other the mistakes of other individuals-which is not right. We have started to solve these problems. Delegations from Hama and Idlib in particular, raised such issues during our meetings. As I said, we have started solving these pending issues and we will solve them completely. We cannot continue living in the shadow of a dark phase in our history that happened three decades ago. These issues relate to the justice and injustice every citizen can associate with. There are other issues related to passports, although two years ago we instructed all ambassadors to start issuing passports even to those who are wanted, whether they fled the country or left it but believe that they are ""wanted"" in Syria. A large number of those were afraid and did not go to the embassies to receive their passports. Even after the amnesty was declared, they did not collect their passports. There is still a kind of fear which prevents people from making an initiative towards state institutions. This fear makes them feel injustice despite the fact that this injustice does not exist. Talking about the amnesty, in my recent meetings I felt that it did not satisfy many people. The fact is that it is the most comprehensive in twenty three years. I believe a similar one was given in 1988. Nevertheless, there is a desire that it should be more comprehensive. We do not usually address names, we put criteria, like saying we give amnesty to all, except drugs, terrorism, issues of public morality, etc. Nevertheless, and based on what I heard from a number of people, or information I received from people I did not meet, I will ask the Ministry of Justice to make a study of the margin that we can use in order to make the amnesty more comprehensive, even in a future decree which includes all the others without undermining state security and interests, on the one hand, and the rights of private individuals, like those whose relatives were killed, on the other. The second component consists of outlaws and wanted for various criminal cases who found in the state's institutions an enemy and a target because they constitute an obstacle for their illegitimate interests and because they are sought by the state's institutions. For those, chaos was a golden opportunity that should be grasped in order to ensure that they remain free and persist in their illegal activities. If it is only natural that we seek to enforce the law on all, it does not mean that we should not look for solutions with a social nature in order to prevent those people from choosing the wrong path and encourage them to be good citizens fully integrated into society. You may be asking about the number of these outlaws and wanted individuals? I myself was surprised with this number. I thought they were a few thousand in the past. The number at the beginning of the crisis was more than 64,400 people. Imagine this number of wanted persons for various criminal cases the verdict of which ranges between few months and execution, and they had escaped justice; the verdict of 24 thousand of those is three years and above. Of course, a few days ago that number dropped slightly to less than 63,000 because some turned themselves in to authorities. Thus, the number is 64,000, may be more or less, and this equals in military terms almost five military divisions, almost a whole army. If a few thousands of those wanted to carry weapons and engage in sabotage, you can imagine what damage can be caused to the state. The third and more dangerous component, despite its small size, consists of those who have extremist and takfiri ideology. We have known and experienced this kind of ideology decades ago when it tried to infiltrate Syria; and Syria was able to eliminate it thanks to the wisdom and intelligence of the Syrian people. The ideology we see today is no different from that we saw decades ago. It is exactly the same. What has changed, however, is the methods and the persons. This kind of ideology lurks in dark corners in order to emerge when an opportunity presents itself or when it finds a handy mask to put on. It kills in the name of religion, destroys in the name of reform, and spreads chaos in the name of freedom. It is very sad to see in any society in the world some groups that belong to other bygone ages, that belong to a period we do not live in and we do not belong to. In fact, this is the biggest obstacle in the reform process because development starts with human beings. It does not start with computers. It does not start with machines. It does not start with legislation or anything else. It starts with human being. Therefore, we have to encircle this ideology if we really want to develop. In any case, there are other components. I did not talk about the external component and its role in this crisis. I did not talk about the components that we all know. There are people who are well paid to carry out video cameras, film and collaborate with the media. Some are paying money for those to participate in demonstrations and to do the video filming. These components do not concern us that much. Peaceful demonstrations were used as a pretext under which armed men took cover That is why, and recalling the course of events, it is found that escalation and chaos have always been the response to every reform announced or accomplished. When they lost all justifications, taking to arms was the only available choice remaining to them in order to execute their plan. In some cases, peaceful demonstrations were used as a pretext under which armed men took cover; in other cases, they attacked civilians, policemen and soldiers by attacking military sites and positions or used assassination. Schools, shops and highways were closed by the use of force, and public property was destroyed, ransacked and put to fire deliberately. Cities were cut from each other by blocking highways. All of this has posed a direct threat to the normal daily life of the citizens and undermined their security, education, economic activity, and communicating with their families. They distorted the country's image in the outside world and opened the way, and even called for, foreign intervention. By doing so, they tried to weaken the national political stand, which adheres to the full return of national rights and supports the legitimate rights of our brothers and supports their resistance. They invoked detestable sectarian discourse which we have never endorsed and in which we only see an expression of a hateful ideology which has never been part of our religion, history or traditions and which has been an anathema and a sacrilege to our national, pan-Arab and moral identity. In all these issues, and with the exception of the first component, I am talking about a small minority which constitutes only a very small part of the Syrian people. That is why it is not cause for concern, but once again I say this should be addressed. When they failed in the first stage, in manipulating the first component, those who have demands, they moved to armed confrontation and acts of violence. When they failed in this, they moved to a new kind of action. They started this in Jisr al-Shughour by committing the atrocious massacres whose images we saw in the media, when they killed security men and destroyed the Post Office. The Post Office is public property: people living in the city use it. There is a great deal of hatred. The important thing is that they possessed sophisticated weapons which did not exist before. They had sophisticated communication systems. They moved to another kind of action. Near the town of Ma'aret al-Nou'man, they tried to strategic fuel and gas depots. They were able to take control of them. They surrounded the army units which tried to restore them. We were surprised that they have modern four wheel drive vehicles on which they installed sophisticated weapons capable of dealing with helicopters. They also had communication equipment. They tried to commit another massacre in Ma'aret al-Nou'man against a security check points. They almost succeeded had not the people of the town intervened to protect the patrol by hiding them in their houses. Some of the town people paid the price by being tortured and having their bones broken. I appreciate the work of all of those who took this patriotic stance and hope to meet them soon. Of course there were many people who tried to do similar things, to prevent sedition in different parts of Syria. Many of them succeeded, and some of them have not succeeded so far. Had it not been for this patriotic feeling that many people have, the situation in Syria could have been much worse. The response came from the Syrian people who have once again come up in force to express their national and patriotic feelings in a manner that superseded all expectations. All this under the heavy shadow of a media campaign launched through satellite TV stations and in cyber space which made it difficult to distinguish what is real from what is illusory and what is genuine from what is fake. But the patriotic feelings and the historic intuition that our people possess, and which are based on an accumulation of experience across generations, were immeasurably more powerful. The importance of this experience, then, is that it showed the extent of national and patriotic awareness which is the most important guarantee for the success of the development and modernization process we are embarked on and which is based on three pillars; awareness, morals, and institutions. The absence of any of these pillars will definitely lead to a deviation of the process from its intended objectives and consequently lead to its failure with all the dangerous consequences on our society and our future. What some people are doing today has nothing to do with development, modernization, or reform. What is happening is a form of destruction, and with every act of destruction we are driven away from our objectives in modernization and development and from our aspirations. And here I do not only mean material destruction, for rectifying this can be easy. I rather mean psychological, moral, and behavioural destruction which becomes difficult to correct as time goes by. And we see that some people are trying to endorse such practices and are gradually enshrining disrespect for state institutions and what they stand for on the national level. This will lead to a slackening of the patriotic and national feelings which are essential for the creation and the protection of the homeland. This is exactly what our enemies want us to do and this is the direction they want us to take. Today we have a generation of children who grew up witnessing these events or learned disorder, lack of respect for institutions, lack of respect for the law and hatred for the state. The consequences of this will not be felt today but later on, and the price will be high. And here I want to raise the question of whether this chaos has produced more job opportunities for job seekers or whether it has improved public conditions. Has it improved the security which we have enjoyed and prided ourselves on? There is no development without stability, and there can be no reform through destruction, sabotage, or chaos. On the other hand, laws and decisions on their own will not be sufficient to achieve any progress in isolation from the appropriate environment. That is why we should rebuild what has been destroyed and we need to correct these destructive elements or isolate them. Only then can we proceed with development and modernization. All the above is concerned with principles. As to practice, however, it should be based on reality; and when we talk about reality we need to talk about people. That is why I started a long series of meetings which have included all sections of society from Syrian regions and governorates in order to see this reality and understand it as it is or to have as close an idea as possible about reality from the different perspectives of the Syrian people and in a manner which helps us arrange the priorities of state institutions in line with the priorities of our citizens. I wanted to understand the details directly from the citizens and without the other channels which might do some filtering of the information. They might pass the information in full, but without the emotions involved; and relationships between people are not only facts and information. There are emotions too. I wanted to build everything I wanted to say in the future on these meetings. Actually, the substance of this speech and what I am saying today is based on the dialogue I had with the citizens. I met people from all sections: demonstrators and non-demonstrators. In fact, I consider these meetings, despite the difficult circumstances surrounding them, the most important thing I have done throughout my years in my official position. Despite the pain and the frustration in the general atmosphere surrounding these meetings, I can say that the benefit I got from them was astonishing. The love I felt from those people who represent most of the Syrian people is something I have never felt at any stage of my life. I certainly reciprocate the love of these people and the love of every Syrian citizen whom I do not know, but hope to meet in similar meetings. But what I hope more than that is to turn this love to action. This, of course, can happen, with your help. These meetings have been useful, frank, in depth and comprehensive. They covered all issues without exception; some of these issues were local, at the level of the city or the governorate, and some were country-wide. My priority was the issues which have a bearing on the largest sections of the Syrian people, and they have been given precedence over local issues, important as they are. Citizens expressed an anger mixed with love and a sense of blame mixed with loyalty because they felt that their state has distanced itself from them by adopting certain policies or by getting involved in certain practices. I sensed that their suffering was multifaceted; for part of it was related to services and living standards and some related to undermining citizens' dignity, ignoring their views or excluding them from participation in the development process of which they are the objective and the substance. But I also felt the love of this people who have always given me, through their sincerity, pride, and steadfastness, the strength to proceed with our political stances and our resistance and noncompliance. Corruption is the result of moral degradation I felt that there is a strong desire to eradicate corruption as a major cause for the lack of justice and equal opportunities and for feelings of unfairness, injustice, and oppression, in addition to its dangerous moral consequences on society. What is more dangerous still, are the cases of unfair discrimination among citizens on abominable narrow-minded bases. This on its own is sufficient for undermining the most powerful of nations. Corruption is the result of moral degradation, the spread of patronage and nepotism, and the absence of institutions, which means the absence of the protector and the guarantor of national feelings which are replaced by narrower feelings of identity. That is why we need to start working immediately in order to strengthen institutions by passing developed legislation and providing these institutions with officials capable of bearing responsibility instead of being born by the positions they occupy. And there will be no leniency towards those who are unable to shoulder this responsibility. But we cannot succeed unless we find the appropriate channels through which citizens can participate and play a role in oversight and in pointing to errors and failures. I told many delegations that the state can address, fight or reduce corruption at the higher levels, while we need to find channels for addressing the problem at lower levels. This is the task of the Anti-Corruption Commission whose mechanisms have been studied by the committee set up for the purpose. These are nice words, but how can they be achieved; for it is easy to say what needs to be done, but putting these words into action is the decisive factor. As I said, I aimed, through these meetings, to have a more in depth knowledge of reality, but I found myself at the heart of genuine national dialogue. National dialogue is not restricted to specific elites. It is not a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition, neither is it necessarily limited to political issues. It is a dialogue between the different sections of society about all national issues. National Dialogue is the title of the Current Stage If we assume that the government can be given a certain size and the opposition a certain size, it is true that in all countries and all societies, the largest section of society is that which does not belong to either. We cannot talk about a national dialogue, about planning for the future and about drawing Syria's future for decades and generations to come by neglecting the largest section of the people. Hence the idea of national dialogue which have started recently. There is no doubt that I was part of a national dialogue; nevertheless, I cannot claim to have accomplished it, because in the end I am only an individual and those I met were hundreds or thousands, and the country includes tens of millions. Hence, the basic idea was to launch a national dialogue in which the widest social, intellectual, and political stakeholders take part in an institutional forum. For this purpose, a national dialogue committee has been set up charged with identifying the principles and mechanisms for ensuring comprehensive dialogue on the different issues of concern to Syrian citizens. The dialogue will allow, on the one hand, a discussion of the proposed draft laws at this stage, and on the other, provides an opportunity to drawing Syria's future in a comprehensive sense for future decades and generations and help us all arrive at a mature vision for this future. It will push forward the political, social, and economic dynamics in our country until political parties can play a wider role in public life after a new party law is passed. A number of views have been expressed about the possible format of the dialogue. And one of the first tasks of the national dialogue committee is to consult with different stakeholders in order to arrive at the best format which enables us to accomplish our reform project within a specific timeframe. As I said in my meeting with the cabinet, everything should be tied to a timeframe, and I believe that you are all calling for a timeframe for everything we talk about. We can say, then, that national dialogue is the title for the present stage. When we started with this idea, we thought that the dialogue should be at governorate level. What I have noticed in my meetings with citizens from different governorates is that the issues themselves are not looked at from the same perspective, and the reason is the large social diversity we have in Syria. Although there are points of convergence, still there are differences to a certain extent. So, in the beginning we thought of conducting the dialogue on governorate level as a first phase in order to move later to central dialogue. The issues raised in this central dialogue will be determined according to agreements reached or the issues around which there was a consensus in the governorate dialogue. However, and after setting up the Dialogue Commission, and in order to reduce the time needed, and as a result of the conditions Syria is going through, they thought of starting directly with central dialogue. There were questions raised which have now become part of the mandate of the Commission. If we want to start dialogue, who should take part, what are the criteria, how to identify the different axes, who takes part in the discussion over which axis, and other technical details. At this moment there is confusion, although this has been explained on television: about the role of the Commission. The Commission does not conduct the dialogue, it rather supervises the dialogue. It lays the mechanisms and identifies the timeframe. After the end of the dialogue, what is agreed upon is referred to the Commission. If there are laws to be passed, they are passed by the president, and if there are other issues which need certain measures, the state follows them up. In any case, the commission did not want to have a monopoly over setting the criteria. It decided to hold a consultative meeting in the next few days to which it invites more than a hundred personalities from the different sections of the Syrian society in order to consult with them about the criteria and the mechanisms. After that, dialogue starts and the Commission identifies a timeframe, one month or two months, in accordance to what the participants in the consultative meeting decide. This dialogue is a very important process, and it should be given an opportunity, because the whole future of Syria, if we want it to succeed, should be based on this dialogue in which all parts of the Syrian spectrum take part. We cannot always expect a vision from the state or from the government. A few scores of people cannot plan for millions of people. This is the importance of this dialogue. As to the urgent needs and demands of the people, they have been put into implementation before the beginning of the dialogue. We have lifted the emergency law and abolished the state security court, steps which will ensure the organization of the work of relevant agencies in a manner that enhances and protects people's dignity without undermining the country's security. We also passed a law regulating the right to peaceful demonstration which strengthens the possibility of expressing views and positions in a free, peaceful, and organized manner as a healthy condition which helps the state rectify failures and correct trends. Questions have been raised about the issue of arrest and detention, for some people found that detentions continued after lifting the state of emergency. I believe that most people, whether in the state, inside and outside the competent authorities, did not understand the meaning of the state of emergency nor the meaning of lifting the state of emergency. However, we stressed the import of this issue. What is important is that any case of arrest takes place after permission is obtained from the Attorney General. There is a specific period allowed for investigation. If they want to extend this period, they should obtain permission from the Attorney General or from the judicial system. But there is a specific time limit. When somebody is caught in the act, there is no need for permission, but the same procedures are followed with the permission of the Attorney General. However, lifting the state of emergency does not mean violating the law. This should be clear. Lifting the state of emergency has nothing to do with legal punishments or the nature of these punishments. Based on our conviction that citizens should be better represented in elected institutions, particularly in the People's Assembly and local administration councils, a committee was set up to draft a new elections law. Principles of justice, equality, integrity, and transparency are the titles of Future This will strengthen the role of these institutions for the public good and enable them to be more effective and ensure wider participation. This will enhance the principles of justice, equality, integrity, and transparency. These principles will be the hallmark of the future which we seek for our country. This issue is now subject to public discussion. The Committee has finished the draft law, and I believe it is going to be an important law, because most of the criticism I heard from the citizens revolves around their representatives in the different councils. This law will give the opportunity to citizens to elect the people who will represent them and represent their interests. Another committee was set up to draft legislation and design the necessary mechanisms for fighting corruption. I believe that it concluded its work yesterday and proposed a draft law which is now subject to public discussion. The Anti-Corruption Commission has been set up in order to reduce it and turn it into an unwanted exception rather than a widespread phenomenon or an inevitable reality. Citizens will play a wide role in oversight and participation in this process. No success can be achieved in eradicating this epidemic without the full participation of all citizens. The media plays a central role in this regard, for they should be the eye and the voice of the citizen. And we have started a large workshop in order to modernize the media, expand the scope of its freedom and strengthen its responsibility so they become a transparent medium of communication between citizens and the state. The law will be subject to public discussion, in order to receive and incorporate feedback before it is passed. I believe the Media Committee has until July 24th to complete its work. As to the local administration law, it has been put in draft and is being discussed. I believe it is one of the most important steps which will be taken in terms of its impact on development or in terms of participation in local administration. It will contribute to addressing a number of problems which cannot be solved under the present central administration. It will regulate the authorities and relationships between the different levels of local administration and will have a positive impact on the general performance and consequently on the citizens. Syrian nationality has been given to Kurdish citizens registered previously as foreigners. This will enhance national unity and contribute to more stability in the long term. There have been over thirty six thousand applications so far, and the number of identity cards given so far is over six thousand seven hundred. Setting up a committee to study a new party law was a major step for political development and widening the scope of democratic life. A new party law will enrich party diversity and allow for more participation for different trends in political life. These laws, this political package I have mentioned, will create a new political reality in Syria through broadening popular participation in the affairs of the sate and making citizens responsible through their contribution to decision making, oversight, and accountability. They will lead to deep transformations at the level of political dynamism and mass activity. This will also lead to reconsideration of many principles of political activity in the country and consequently make it necessary to revise the constitution in order either to amend some of its articles or make a new constitution in line with the economic, political and social changes in Syria during the past four decades since it was passed. This package will be presented to national dialogue. Of course there are a number of points which need to be mentioned regarding this package. Some people believe that there is a certain degree of procrastination on the part of the state regarding political reform. In other words, they imply that the state is not serious about this reform. I want to stress that the reform process for us is a matter of complete and absolute conviction because it represents the interest of the country, and because it expresses the desire of the people, and no reasonable person can oppose the people or the interest of the country. What is more important is that there is no opposition to reform. This is a question which has been put to me. I personally have not met any individual in the state who opposes reform. Everybody is enthusiastic for reform. The problem, however, is what reform do we want? What are the details? The package of laws which I have mentioned consists of laws in the general sense. But what are the details which we want and which we believe are useful? Some people expect that the law is passed and the president signs it, so it is easy. Can this happen? Does this lead to positive results and achieve the public interests? Maybe. And when I say maybe I mean that all possibilities are there. We cannot do something crucial and carry out a full reform process after fifty years of a certain political structure, and move forward by leaping into the unknown. We need to know where we are going and what to expect. What we are doing now is making our future, and making the future is a sort of history. The history or the future which we are making will affect future generations for decades to come. Even if they make amendments in line with their circumstances in the future, still what we do now is something of crucial importance which will affect Syria's future. That is why we need to have the broadest possible participation; and hence the importance of national dialogue. We need the broadest possible participation in order to have a wider take on things and to have a far-reaching impact on the future. When some people say that the president should lead the reform process, this does not mean that he can replace the people and carry out the reform process on his own. Leadership does not mean that one individual should stand alone but rather he should be in front and the people proceed with him. Leadership is a process of consultation and interaction. And here I reiterate the importance of national dialogue. What are the things that the dialogue should focus on? We are talking about an election law. Which election law is in the best interest of Syria? Do we want small constituencies, medium-size constituencies or large constituencies? Every option has its positive and negative aspects. Which election law achieves full integration for Syrian society and does not lead to fragmentation? Which election law is better suited to the new party law which we want? What is the party law which leads to full integration of Syrian society and preserves Syria's unity and at the same time prevents Syria from turning into a ball rather than a player, as it used to be decades ago. There are so many questions which need to be raised. As to the election law, do we want to elect an individual or a programme? There are questions, and so far we do not have answers. Even if we have an answer, we should not say that this is the right answer and proceed carrying all the negative aspects to the future generations. We should take responsibility together. We have people with a great degree of awareness, and the question is that of discussion. So, we need to answer these questions, and these are only samples of a larger variety of questions. There are others; do we pass the party law and the election law before the elections for the People's Assembly? The majority say yes. Some people want to separate the election's law from the party law and want the new Assembly to pass the party law. Do we want to postpone the People's Assembly elections for three months, as some people have proposed or do we have them on time? As far as we are concerned, we do not want to adopt a certain answer for these questions. We want to be impartial as a state. What is important is public consensus. If there is no consensus on these and other issues, we will have a big problem in Syria. As to the constitution, this is a slightly separate question. Do we replace a few articles of the constitution, including article (8), or do we change the whole constitution since it was written about forty years ago, and it might be better to change it completely. Some people suggest that we undertake certain steps now and amend some articles, and later on make a revision of the whole constitution. And if some articles need to be amended, then they should be amended by a new People's Assembly. If what is needed is changing the whole constitution, this needs a public referendum. There are numerous questions but the main question is within this framework. I can raise them without giving a timeframe, but it is better if we give a timeframe even in light of all these questions. Now, most committees have completed their work with the exception of the Media Committee which will complete its work in July. The Party Law Committee will finish in the next few days. If we complete the Party and Election Laws, the most important for political reform, we can start the national dialogue directly and discuss all these laws and the laws which will be passed later. Concerning national dialogue, I do not want to set a timeframe on their behalf, but some of those involved suggest a month and others suggest two months. In any case, if the People's Assembly elections are not postponed, they will be held in August, and we will have a new People's Assembly in August. We can say that we can complete this package by the end of August. By the beginning of September all this package will be completed. The constitution is different because it needs the People's Assembly. If the new People's Assembly is elected in August, it can directly start studying the constitutional amendments. If they are postponed as a result of a decision taken in the process of national dialogue for three months, the package will be completed before the end of the year, i.e. in five months. However, if we want to have a full revision of the constitution and to have a new one, the process is completely different. Then we should have a constitutional assembly which proposes the constitution for the public referendum. But what we will do immediately is to set up a committee to study the issue of the constitution in order to save time. The committee will start its work in the next few days and we will give it a month, which I think is sufficient. It will refer its studies to national dialogue, and then we will have a clear time frame, let us say three months until the beginning of September or five months until the end of the year. But we are moving ahead with all the laws and with studying the constitution which will be the last phase. A lot has been said about the delays in reform. I talked about this in front of the People's Assembly and said that we are a bit late. Some people started to ask why they are late. There is no justification. I said that we are late but did not say that we have stopped. In other words, the law for lifting the state of emergency was ready about eighteen months ago and the draft party law was also ready about a year ago. We started preparing the local administration law less than a year ago. The reason why we have not passed the first and second laws is that we believe that the local administration law, which is the most important in the reform process, has two aspects to it; elections and participation. Getting to the local administration law, in any case, requires amending the election law. So it was a matter of priorities, and we did not neglect the other laws. We looked at priorities then in a different way from that we look at them now. Amidst this huge workshop of reform, laws and dialogue, we have not forgotten the day to day living problems of the Syrian citizen which remain more urgent. The government passed a number of decisions with the objective of improving people's living standards. One of the most important decisions was to reduce diesel prices, for it was one of the most frequent demands made by all the delegations which I met without exception. I hope that its impacts on the living standards will be felt in the near future, particularly among the poorer sections of the Syrian population. We also worked on reducing constructions costs through reconsidering with the Engineers' Association the related fees in order to ease the financial burdens on citizens to the extent available resources allow. We hope that the general reduction of costs will push the economy forward, increase job opportunities and compensate the large losses suffered by the Syrian economy during the current events. They would increase the suffering of the citizens if we do not face them with rapid procedures that mitigate the pressure at the present and reverse its direction later on. This is a group of measures aimed at alleviating the crisis and reducing burdens on Syrian citizens. There are other measures taken by the government; but what is important now is for all of us to work in order to restore confidence in the Syrian economy. The most dangerous thing we will face is the weakness or the collapse of the Syrian economy. A large part of the problem is psychological; and we should not allow fear or frustration to defeat us. We should defeat the problem by returning to normal life. Returning to normalcy has a moral impact, and the economy is affected by the psychological condition of the population. We should go back to normal life as far as possible. The crisis might give us a bloody nose, might give us pain, might shake us, might throw us on the ground, but we should rise again stronger and more tenacious in order to carry out our life normally. Here I want to express my thanks and appreciation for all the citizens who have taken part in the campaign to support the Syrian pound. There are people who have less than a thousand Syrian pounds, yet they contributed. Some have thousands and they did the same thing. One day, after we overcome the crisis. God willing, we should ask all those who have money about the role they played, how they contributed to this campaign. This is a national duty. Administrative development remains the biggest challenge in the work of our institutions. And we will proceed in our plans by regulating authorities and controlling practices in order to prevent overlapping in the work of different institutions or in the work of individuals from inside and outside the state. We should also adopt sound criteria for choosing personnel and assessing performance. In other words, we should prevent nepotism. Measures have been taken, and so far about one hundred and twenty security permissions, which have been part of bureaucratic procedures, have been abolished. At the same time the work of the security systems has been recently separated from the work of civil institutions. We need to rely more on inspection, the judiciary, financial control and the Anti-Corruption Commission in its new format. The media contributes to oversight by providing transparency to government work, and it will constitute a channel of communication between state institutions and the citizens, in addition to other channels between state officials and citizens, either directly or through the organizations and trade unions which represent their interests. We should also examine economic issues and we need to look for a new economic model. In the past there were two models; the socialist and the capitalist. Many people believe that these models have fallen. Now we do not have ready-made experiences to take and implement. We need to look for a model which suits Syria. The measures we have taken now have to do with dealing with the media and dealing with suffering. In other words, they deal with temporary problems and do not solve the problem in the long term. If we do not know the model suitable to Syria and which achieves social equity between the rich and the poor, the country and the city, we will have a problem. Because there is already a big problem in the disparity between the country and the city despite the balanced economic policy which Syria has followed in terms of providing equal opportunities and economic independence and relying on local resources. I believe that this issue needs national dialogue on the economy, something we will do later in order to move ahead in this field. These are some basic titles for the next phase. These titles are the axes around which any other evolves. There is no doubt that one single speech would not address all the raised issues. Therefore, the national dialogue will be the method through which any issue that enriches what I talked about in my speech or more than that could be raised. Next stage is the stage of turning Syria into a construction workshop to compensate for time and damages The next stage is the stage of turning Syria into a construction workshop to compensate for time and damages, and to rectify rifts and heal wounds; when the blood of any Syrian citizen whoever he is and in whatever circumstances is spilled, this means that the entire nation is bleeding. Stopping this bleeding is a national responsibility every citizen should be involved in. Sitting on the fence, however, is to deepen the wound. We are all responsible for protecting the security and stability of the country regardless of our positions and views. We will prosecute and hold responsible anyone who spilled blood or sought to do so. The delay of legal procedures for bureaucratic reasons does not mean procrastination and does not mean indulgence because the damage that happened impacted everyone; and bringing all those responsible to account is the right of the state as much as it is the right of individuals. The Judicial Investigation Committee is proceeding with its work without any intervention. It has full immunity and independence. I follow up their work from time to time, but it does not work according to political criteria. It works in accordance with legal criteria, which means that they constantly look for evidence in order to indict any individual. Some people believe that the Commission has not done anything yet. This is not true. It has arrested a number of individuals involved in the crisis and they are completing their investigation in order to bring them to justice and it will continue to move in this direction. When we enforce the law, this does not mean revenge in any way against people who have violated the law without killing or destruction. The state is like a mother or father who embraces everyone and accommodates all her children; the state's relationship with them is based on tolerance and love, not on hatred and revenge, and when the state forgives those who make mistakes, it aims at enshrining this sound relationship between the state and the citizens. But this does not mean the abandonment of toughness when it comes to harming the public interest. There are those who say that some demonstrators continue to demonstrate because they demonstrated in the past and believe that they will be prosecuted by the state. We announced an amnesty for all those who turn themselves in during the months of April and May. There were those who turned themselves in with their weapons, and they were pardoned immediately. And I say to all these people: try to contact the state and you will find a positive response and tolerance on part of state institutions, even regarding those who have carried weapons but did not use them against anyone. However, as for terrorizing citizens and committing acts of killing and terrorism, this is another issue and the state cannot but enforce the full extent of the law. At the same time, I call on all those who have left their cities or villages to return. The return of the displaced is a very important issue, because a city dies without its people. And we cannot talk about normal life and economic life while there are people who left their towns and villages and went to other places. I call on every individual and every family who left their cities or villages to return as soon as possible. And I stress that the Syrian government calls on all those who left Jisr al-Shughour and the villages surrounding it to Turkey to return immediately. There are those who tell them or suggest to them that the state will take revenge against them. I assure them that this is not true. The army is there for their security and the security of their children. So, we hope to see them soon in Jisr al-Shugour. Every individual might ask how can I contribute? I want to do something. How can I contribute to solving this problem? Of course we do not have complete solutions but we can contribute now. I say that there is a role that the people can play and a role that the state can play. The state plays its role through the reforms I talked about; political reform, economic reform, and reform in other areas. The state has a role to play in providing services. There are deficiencies. There are grievances. There are measures which have harmed the citizens. The state should rectify these deficiencies. Those who have been involved in acts of killing, terrorization and destruction will be brought to justice and prosecuted. It is the duty of the state to prosecute them. In this regard, some people debate whether the solution should be political or security-based. They say that the security-based solution has failed, and consequently the state should proceed in the direction of the political solution. In fact, we in the state think that the solution should be political. The problem consists of political, economic and social demands. But what identifies the method of solving the problem is not the state's view but the nature of the problem itself. It is not the state which wanted, desired, or forced those who are involved in acts of destruction; neither can we deal with those politically. This is not reasonable. There is no political solution for those who carry weapons and kill. We want a political solution and want the army to go back to its barracks as soon as possible. We want security personnel to go back to their offices, premises, and positions, also as soon as possible. The normal thing is for citizens to deal with the police and the judiciary. Citizens have nothing to do with the army or with security personnel. The problem is that the police force in Syria is small and the police have not been trained for such cases. We started recruitment, but the capacity is limited, and at the same time training takes a long time. In any case, and regardless of the crisis, if we want to regulate the relationship between the citizen and the state in this direction, this needs some time. As to citizens, to the people, the first thing I want to say is we want them to support reform, and this is self-evident, because the people are demanding reform, so it is only natural for them to support reform. But supporting reform takes place by distinguishing between real reformists and those involved in destruction and sabotage, and also isolating those who want to ride the wave of reform in order to make personal gain. We want them to prevent chaos. As I said, there are those who acted in order to prevent chaos; parents with their children, brothers with each other, friends among each other. It is a process of awareness raising. We want the demonstrations to be turned into pens, to written opinions, to ideas, to dialogue, to acts on the ground. Now I am not talking about something theoretical, I am talking rather about something practical. In many places, the security forces were withdrawn and the people of the region started to work with the state for the development process, in fighting corruption, in order to preserve the security of the villages and cities in which they live. This requires the existence of channels between these people and the state. When we created these channels, they turned form demonstrators into individuals who wanted to build their country. A demonstration is an expression of pain, of suffering that the state has not responded to. When the state responded, the situation became completely different. We can increase the number of these channels in order to turn every individual into a productive citizen. This is of course a temporary phase until political parties start to play their role in the future, for parties are the natural channel for transforming the energy of individuals into action on the ground and contributing to the return to normal life. This is the most important, even if the crisis went on for months or years, we should accommodate ourselves to it, we should corner it and make it limited to those who are concerned with the crisis. Now we have an army there. Until the army returns to their barracks, we have to support this army and ask for its support everywhere. The army consists of the brothers of every Syrian citizen, and the army always stands for honour and dignity. Young people have an important role to play at this stage, because they have proven themselves to be an active power. There is the electronic army which has been a real army in virtual reality. There were those who took part in the blood donation campaign, and other initiatives. I met a number of youth delegations from different sections of society and found that Syrian youth enjoy a high sense of patriotism, and this is self-evident because they belong to this country. This generation has to prepare itself for the next political phase so that we become the model for the whole region. Instead of taking lessons from others, we will teach them. In this speech, I touched on a number of important points. I met a large number of delegations, and I have a list of issues which number over one thousand and a hundred big and small issues, and every one of those I met would wish that I raised the issue they touched on, for everyone believes that his issue is an important one. I mentioned these issues not because they encompass all our problems, but because they are the most important and most comprehensive. As to the other issues, we in the state are addressing them continuously. The intensive meetings with public delegations have allowed me to expand the direct communication channels which principally exist between me and the citizens. These channels have formed a rich source of information on the reality with all its facts, and this is what any official needs. In the next stage, I will continue holding such meetings which, in addition to providing me with confidence, are the compass according which our internal policies will be built. The same goes for foreign policy which I sought to base on the pulse of the street and reflect in every situation we faced; this popular pulse which does not accept anything short of Syria as an independent state both on its land and its decisions. This popular pulse which refuses to let the homeland be a ball instead of being a player on its own court. This pulse refuses to allow its role to be measured according to its geographical size rather than its historical importance. Otherwise, Syria will be besieged within its borders, rather than reaching out to its natural and vital regional dimension, and thus to turn into a state of rival tribes living on the crumbs thrown to her children from outside the borders. Through all of that, we must realize that achieving reform and development does not only represent an internal need, but it is necessary and vital to confront those plans; and therefore we have no option but to succeed in the domestic project in order to succeed in our external project. The pressures are directed against Syria's role in resisting the schemes of sectarian division in the region which will mean that there is neither resistance nor rights, but collapse and surrender. Accomplishing security is our starting point; and the people are the most capable to be entrusted with maintaining security and protecting the homeland. I am saying this based on experience and reality, not out of courtesy. Those who protected the country through hard times, and those who protected it today are the people, the young people who confronted dangers, made initiatives and implemented things on the ground, forming popular committees and youth groups, making personal initiatives which kept the country's name high and reflected its spirit and the pulse of its youth and people. The power of the state is derived from the power of the people whose power is derived from their dignity, which in turn is derived from their freedom, which is again derived from the power of their state. So, let the people embrace the sate and let the army, the security personnel, the police and the people work hand in hand to prevent sedition, protect the homeland and ensure its supremacy. Syria's destiny is to face crises; but it is also its destiny to be proud, strong, resistant and victorious. Its destiny is to come out of crises stronger thanks to the solidarity and cohesion of its society, its deeply rooted values and the determination of its people who are endowed with intelligence, civilization and openness. It is you who prevented the confusion between the greed and designs of superpowers, on the one hand, and people's desire for reform and change on the other. It is you who protected the flower of youth from being sacrificed to the greed of international powers. It is you who prevented all attempts of sectarian sedition scrambling at the gates of the homeland and cut off the head of the snake before it could bite the Syrian body and kill it. I say that as long as you enjoy this great spirit and this deep sense of identity, Syria is fine and safe."
USA_Doc1_Speech_Dom,"BUSH: Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow Americans, in the normal course of events, presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the union. Tonight, no such report is needed; it has already been delivered by the American people. We have seen it in the courage of passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground. Passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me welcome his wife Lisa Beamer here tonight? (APPLAUSE) We have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaustion. We've seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers in English, Hebrew and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of union, and it is strong. (APPLAUSE) Tonight, we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. (APPLAUSE) I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol singing ``God Bless America.'' And you did more than sing. You acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military. Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our country. (APPLAUSE) And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our national anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America. Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own. Dozens of Pakistanis, more than 130 Israelis, more than 250 citizens of India, men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan, and hundreds of British citizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. (APPLAUSE) Once again, we are joined together in a great cause. I'm so honored the British prime minister had crossed an ocean to show his unity with America. Thank you for coming, friend. (APPLAUSE) On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country. Americans have known wars, but for the past 136 years they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of war, but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known surprise attacks, but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single day, and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack. Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking, ``Who attacked our country?'' The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and responsible for bombing the USS Cole. Al Qaeda is to terror what the Mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money, its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere. The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics; a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction. The leadership of Al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan we see Al Qaeda's vision for the world. Afghanistan's people have been brutalized, many are starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough. The United States respects the people of Afghanistan--after all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid--but we condemn the Taliban regime. (APPLAUSE) It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. And tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban. Deliver to United States authorities all of the leaders of Al Quaeda who hide in your land. (APPLAUSE) Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens you have unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. And hand over every terrorist and every person and their support structure to appropriate authorities. (APPLAUSE) Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. (APPLAUSE) The Taliban must act and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists or they will share in their fate. I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. (APPLAUSE) The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them. (APPLAUSE) Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated. (APPLAUSE) Americans are asking ``Why do they hate us?'' They hate what they see right here in this chamber: a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa. These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us because we stand in their way. We're not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They're the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by abandoning every value except the will to power, they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way to where it ends in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. (APPLAUSE) Americans are asking, ""How will we fight and win this war?'' We will direct every resource at our command--every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war--to the destruction and to the defeat of the global terror network. Now, this war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat. Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation in every region now has a decision to make: Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. (APPLAUSE) From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. Our nation has been put on notice, we're not immune from attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight, I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me, the Office of Homeland Security. And tonight, I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. (APPLAUSE) He will lead, oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come. These measures are essential. The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it where it grows. (APPLAUSE) Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents, to intelligence operatives, to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers. And tonight a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready. I have called the armed forces to alert, and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud. This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is not just America's freedom. This is the world's fight. This is civilization's fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom. We ask every nation to join us. We will ask and we will need the help of police forces, intelligence service and banking systems around the world. The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support--nations from Latin America to Asia to Africa to Europe to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO charter reflects best the attitude of the world: An attack on one is an attack on all. The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror unanswered can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And you know what? We're not going to allow it. (APPLAUSE) Americans are asking, ``What is expected of us?'' I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat. I ask you to uphold the values of America and remember why so many have come here. We're in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith. (APPLAUSE) I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, Libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it. I ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle. I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity; they did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people. These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11, and they are our strengths today. And finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead. Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together. Tonight we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency. (APPLAUSE) We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. (APPLAUSE) We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act and to find them before they strike. (APPLAUSE) We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy and put our people back to work. Tonight, we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. (APPLAUSE) As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild New York City. (APPLAUSE) After all that has just passed, all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror. This will be an age of liberty here and across the world. (APPLAUSE) Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human freedom, the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time, now depends on us. Our nation, this generation, will lift the dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter and we will not fail. (APPLAUSE) It is my hope that in the months and years ahead life will return almost to normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines and that is good. Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened. We will remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or story or rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene (ph), as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. (APPLAUSE) I will not forget the wound to our country and those who inflicted it. I will not yield, I will not rest, I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people. The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them. (APPLAUSE) Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice, assured of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom and may he watch over the United States of America. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)"
USA_Doc2_Speech_For,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, and ladies and gentlemen. We meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by violence, in a nation awakened to danger, in a world uniting for a long struggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our future against terror and lawless violence. The United Nations was founded in this cause. In a second world war, we learned there is no isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity, itself. And we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively, and collectively, before they threaten us all. That evil has returned, and that cause is renewed. A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read the names of every person who died, it would take more than three hours. Those names include a citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week. Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca five times a day, and died that day trying to save others. The suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world's oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, they fund it with drug dealing; they encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God's blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a murderer. Time is passing. Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 11th. We will remember every rescuer who died in honor. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children. And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to protect them. However long it takes, their hour of justice will come. Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder -- perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations. They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression. Every other country is a potential target. And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all: These same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. This threat cannot be ignored. This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the civilization we share, is threatened. History will record our response, and judge or justify every nation in this hall. The civilized world is now responding. We act to defend ourselves and deliver our children from a future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion, and chaos. These commitments -- hope and order, law and life -- unite people across cultures and continents. Upon these commitments depend all peace and progress. For these commitments, we are determined to fight. The United Nations has risen to this responsibility. On the 12th of September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world. And I want to thank you for this strong and principled stand. I also thank the Arab Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The authors of mass murder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith. The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be a part of every action against the enemy. But every nation in our coalition has duties. These duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning. We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives. We're taking new measures to investigate terror and to protect against threats. The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of governments. They need the support of a financial infrastructure, and safe havens to train and plan and hide. Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to help. Some governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are mistaken. And some governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N., have cast their lot with the terrorists. They support them and harbor them, and they will find that their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and eventually consume them. For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice. The Taliban are now learning this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabal's soccer stadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings. The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We're making progress against military targets, and that is our objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I'm proud of the honorable conduct of the American military. And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war. The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation. Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United States and other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression. I make this promise to all the victims of that regime: The Taliban's days of harboring terrorists and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close. And when that regime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the rest of the world: good riddance. I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter. America has air-dropped over 1.3 million packages of rations into Afghanistan. Just this week, we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban tried to steal the food we send. More help eventually will be needed. The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States will work with the U.N. to support a post-Taliban government that represents all of the Afghan people. In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone. After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence. And my country has been very grateful for both. The memorials and vigils around the world will not be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived. The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations. On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373. Its requirements are clear: Every United Nations member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every financial institution in every nation. We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know something, tell us. If we know something, we'll tell you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice. We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or transit to terrorists. Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations. We have a responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them. These obligations are urgent and they are binding on every nation with a place in this chamber. Many governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it. Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and more is expected of our coalition against terror. We're asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight. We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them. In this world there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where the line is drawn. Yet, there is no such thing as a good terrorist. No national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick and choose its terrorist friends, will know the consequences. We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of terror. The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through violence grows. We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade. My country is pledged to investing in education and combatting AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world. Following September 11th, these pledges are even more important. In our struggle against hateful groups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope. The American government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live peacefully together within secure and recognize borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations. But peace will only come when all have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror. And, finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself. And the world needs its principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to the world's most persistent violators of human rights. The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral authority -- and that authority must be preserved. The steps I described will not be easy. For all nations, they will require effort. For some nations, they will require great courage. Yet, the cost of inaction is far greater. The only alternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field. As I've told the American people, freedom and fear are at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative culture that defines us. But the outcome of this conflict is certain: There is a current in history and it runs toward freedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined by liberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live in dignity. When men and women are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and they leave poverty by the millions. These aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the Islamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied. We're confident, too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is the teaching of many faiths, and in that assurance we gain strength for a long journey. It is our task -- the task of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression and terror. We have no other choice, because there is no other peace. We did not ask for this mission, yet there is honor in history's call. We have a chance to write the story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go forward, confident, determined, and unafraid. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"
USA_Doc3_Interv_Dom,"An interview of President Bush by Tom Brokaw of NBC News aboard Air Force One: Q Mr. President, there's no tougher decision any President makes than to commit the nation to war. Let's talk about that first night, when you surprised us all by launching the preemptive strike against the residence of Saddam Hussein. THE PRESIDENT: Well, they started in the Situation Room, and we had Tommy Franks on the screen with a Commander -- I think out of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait City and out of -- and a CENTCOM commander out of Tampa Bay, along with their British and Australian counterparts. And then we had the national security team aligned on the table there. I went around to each of the commanders and said, are you happy with the strategy, do you have what it takes to win the war? They all answered affirmatively. I then gave the instructions to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld that Operation Iraqi Freedom would commence at a time of Tommy Franks' choosing. Told Tommy, you know, for the sake of peace and security and the freedom of the Iraqi people that he's got the orders to proceed. I asked God for blessing on him and the troops. He saluted, I saluted back and left the room. It was a -- it was an emotional moment for me because I had obviously made up my mind that if we needed to, we would use troops to get rid of weapons of mass destruction to free the Iraqi people. But the actual moment of making that decision was a heavy moment. I then went outside and walked around the grounds, just to get a little air and collect my thoughts. I thought I was pretty well through with the day, until 3:40 p.m. that afternoon, when I got a call from Secretary Rumsfeld that said, Mr. President, the plans have changed. He said, I would like to change the plans, I need your permission to change the plans. Can I come over? He didn't say, the plans had changed, but I knew what he told me on the phone, it would mean the plans would have changed. And that is, we had a shot at Saddam Hussein they thought. So I assembled the national security team of the Vice President, Colin Powell, Rumsfeld, Myers, CIA Tenet, Condi Rice, Andy Card and some other CIA agents there -- some guys I hadn't seen before came in the Oval. And the reason why they were there is they had a source on the ground that was convinced that not only would Saddam Hussein be in the complex, but Uday and Qusay, his two sons, would be there as well. And they explained why this was the case. And basically they were asking permission from me to launch an air strike. I was hesitant at first, to be frank with you, because I was worried that the first pictures coming out of Iraq would be a wounded grandchild of Saddam Hussein -- but Saddam Hussein, who was not there at the time we started making the decision, would never show up -- that the first images of the American attack would be death to young children. And this is an interesting moment, because as time went on during the day, or that evening, the intelligence got richer and richer. In other words, the guy on the ground was calling in to the CENTCOM headquarters, who was immediately calling in to the White House more and more information. For example, he discovered that there was a bunker a hundred feet away from one of the houses -- a bunker that had so much concrete and was likely to house Saddam when he arrived, and his kids, his boys. And as the intelligence got richer, I got more confident with the notion that Saddam would, in fact, be there. And at 7:15 p.m. that evening, I gave the order for Tommy to proceed with an attack on the farms, but changed -- they had an ordnance package of 30 cruise missiles. But because of the bunker they had to change the timing of the attack so that the stealth bomber went in first, unloaded his ordnance and then the TLAMs, or the cruise missiles would follow in behind. Which means they had to reprogram all these missiles. And they didn't have much time to do it because the flight time of the missiles from their particular launch sites was about two hours. This other thing that bothered me during the decision-making was that the stealth would go in unescorted -- there would have been no air suppression on enemy defenses prior to him going in, in order to keep the element of surprise alive. So the day changed, and it was a dramatic several hours because we really changed the battle plan. Q Did you watch that on television, when the bombs began to land? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did. I did. Actually, they began to hit and then I went in and shortly thereafter addressed the nation -- so I was getting make-up and talking about the -- you know, figuring out the words in the speech. I did. And it was about 9:30 p.m., as I recall, and then I spoke to the country about 10:15 p.m. But what was interesting, Tom, I don't think many people know this, is that the game plan was to move Special Ops forces early, at noon that day. And we would have explained to the country, as kind of creating the conditions for the battlefield, so that when our troops moved significantly their conditions would be ripe for success. At Friday, at noon, I was going to address the nation about the air campaign, and the ground campaign would follow shortly thereafter. Turns out that because we conducted the air raid, I had to speak that night to the country. And then Tommy said he was going to move the ground force movement up early to secure oil fields and to move as quickly as possible into Iraq -- which really says that he had the ability and the authority and the flexibility necessary to change a war plan to meet the needs on the ground. Q That human intelligence that we had on the ground, did you hear back from him, I presume? THE PRESIDENT: We did. Q And did he -- THE PRESIDENT: He felt like we got Saddam. Q He did? THE PRESIDENT: He felt like that, yes. And we're trying, of course, to verify. And before there's any declaration, of course, there will be a lot of evidence. Q Did you see that famous television video of Saddam the next day, in the glasses, reading out from the notepad and so on? THE PRESIDENT: Well, yes. I was amused by that, almost as amused by that as I was his PR man -- it was one of the classics -- probably helping NBC Saturday Night Live out mightily, but through his -- it was just unbelievable what he was saying. But, you know, the people that wonder if Saddam Hussein is dead or not, there's some evidence that says, suggests he might be. We would never make that declaration until we were more certain. But the person that helped direct the attacks believes that Saddam, at the very minimum, was severely wounded. Q That night? THE PRESIDENT: That night, yes. And it explains -- again, there will be a lot of speculation until the truth is known, but it explains why, for example, one reason why dams weren't blown up or oil fields weren't destroyed -- even though we found them to be wired with -- potentially to be blown up. Q Now, the air campaign is underway and troops are moving across the border -- THE PRESIDENT: That would be a day and a half later. Q A day and a half later. THE PRESIDENT: But troops were moving across the border earlier. Q ""Shock and awe"" was the phrase that was heard so much before it all began. It didn't have exactly the effect I think that a lot of people expected, because the resistance down south was from the militia, at least, were tougher than a lot of people anticipated. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think it's true. I think that's an accurate look back. Shock and awe said to many people that all we've got to do is unleash some might and people will crumble. And it turns out the fighters were a lot fiercer than we thought. Because, for example, we didn't come north from Turkey, Saddam Hussein was able to move a lot of special Republican Guard units and fighters from north to south. So the resistance for our troops moving south and north was significant resistance. On the other hand, our troops handled it, handled that resistance quite well. Q Did that give you a pause for a while? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I had confidence in the plan, because I've got confidence in my national security team. Remember, my advisors are people such as Dick Cheney, who had been through the war before as the Secretary of Defense; Colin Powell, who's not only an Army general, but also had been through a war before; Don Rumsfeld, who's a very successful man in the private sector, but also has got great judgment when it comes to the military; Tommy Franks, I really trust Tommy, we speak the same language -- after all, Tommy went to Midland Lee High School, graduated in 1963, one year ahead of Laura; Condi. I get good, solid advice from people who analyzed this war plan, analyzed the strategy, looked over it in depth, had looked at it for quite a bit of time and convinced me that it would lead to victory. So I've never doubted the plan. Obviously, I was concerned when we lost life, or concerned that day when some of our prisoners, the people were captured. But I had confidence in the plan because I had confidence in the team. Q Let me ask you about that day that the prisoners were captured. Everything played out on television. There's been probably no more televised event in the history of mankind. Suddenly you look on the screen and from Iraqi television there are five American prisoners of war, including a woman who was a cook, Shoshana Johnson. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I believe that was a Sunday. And it was a tough day. It was a tough day for America, it was a tough day for the Commander-in-Chief, who committed these young soldiers into battle in the first place. Which made their release even more joyous. But war is -- it's tough. Q Did you make some calls? THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't. I've written a lot of letters, but I didn't call any parents then. I prayed for them, but I didn't call. Q Did you talk to Laura about it? THE PRESIDENT: I did. I talked to Laura a lot during this period of time. She's been a steady source of strength and inspiration and love. You know, any time there's war and a lot of action, a lot of movement of troops and equipment, people are -- there's going to be death. And it's the hardest aspect of this job, frankly, is to know that those lives were lost because of orders I gave. On the other hand, I firmly believe, and history will prove, that decisions that I made and the actions that our country took will make the world more peaceful, help secure the United States. And, as importantly, give the Iraqi people freedom, let them be free -- free from the clutches of one of the most barbaric regimes in the history of mankind. Q The flip side of all that was the rescue of Jessica Lynch. THE PRESIDENT: It was. Q Did you get advanced notice that that operation was going down? THE PRESIDENT: I did. I did. Secretary Rumsfeld told me not to get my hopes up, but there was going to be a very sensitive operation into a hospital where he thought that there would be an American POW. And that's all he said. He was very circumspect, as he should be, to a lot of people, because he didn't want any information to get out that might have jeopardized the operation. But he gave me a heads-up. And then when we heard that she had been rescued, it was a joyous moment. Q Let me ask you about some of the larger policy questions. Before we went to war against Iraq, one of the reasons that you justified this war was that he posed a real threat to the United States. If he couldn't defend his own country -- and we have not yet been able to find the weapons of mass destruction, which were not even launched in defense of Iraq -- was that overstated? THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I think time and investigation will prove a couple of points. One, that he did have terrorist connections. And, secondly, that he had a weapons of mass destruction program -- we know he had a weapons of mass destruction program. We now know he's not going to use them. So we've accomplished one objective, and that is that Saddam Hussein will not hurt the United States or friends or our allies with weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, we are learning more as we interrogate or have discussions with Iraqi scientists and people within the Iraqi structure, that perhaps he destroyed some, perhaps he dispersed some. We also know there are hundreds and hundreds of sites available for hiding the weapons, which he did effectively for 10 years from the -- over 10 years from the United Nations. And that we've only looked at about 90 of those sites so far. I mean, literally hundreds of sites. And so we will find them. But it's going to take time to find them. And the best way to find them is to continue to collect information from the humans, Iraqis who were involved with hiding them. Q As you know, there's still a lot of skepticism around the world about American motives in Iraq. THE PRESIDENT: Right. Q Why not fold in some of the U.N. inspectors to this effort, not turn it over to them, but make them a part of it? Would that help with the credibility, do you think? THE PRESIDENT: I think there's going to be skepticism until people find out there was, in fact, a weapons of mass destruction program. One thing there can't be skepticism about is the fact that this guy was torturous and brutal on the Iraqi people. I mean, he brutalized them, he tortured them, he destroyed them, he cut out their tongues when they dissented. And now the people are beginning to see what freedom means within Iraq. Look at the Shia marches, or the Shia pilgrimages that are taking place. The world will see that the United States is interested in peace, is interested in security and interested in freedom. Q But it is important to find the weapons of mass destruction, or the evidence that he had a massive program underway, isn't it? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I think we will. I'm pretty confident we will. Q Your old family friend, Brent Scowcroft, who has some differences with the policies here, says one of the things that he's worried about is that there's no tradition of democracy there, that people will just seize power wherever they can. It seems to a lot of people that that is playing out in the south, especially where the Shia are saying, look, we're going to run things here, we'd like to have an Islamic government. Isn't that a serious concern? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, we just started. The country isn't secure yet. I mean, the first things that we're worried about is making sure that the militia units of the old Fedayeen Saddam aren't out killing people. So our troops are working with coalition forces to make the country more secure. Secondly, we're worried about making sure there are -- there's the presence of a police force in these different cities to maintain order. We are just beginning to move our teams in place to help the Iraqi bureaucracies get up and running. I was pleased to see that the Doctors Without Borders organization said that they went into Iraq and found no grave humanitarian crisis. In other words, the food is getting to the people, medicines are getting to the people. They did say there is a shortage of personnel, professionally -- not a shortage of medicine, but a shortage of professionals necessary to deliver the aid, and we'll help the Iraqi people address that problem. My point to you is that we have an orderly process to bring stability and food and health to the Iraqi people, so life can begin to return to normal. And then I'm confident that a government will emerge. I dismiss the critics who say that democracy can't flourish in Iraq. It may not look like America. You know, Thomas Jefferson may not emerge. But, nevertheless, I do believe there can be a representative government and all factions can be represented. Q But if it becomes an Islamic government -- with a 60 percent Shiite majority, it could very well become that -- would that be acceptable to you? THE PRESIDENT: What I would like to see is a government where church and state are separated. And I believe there's enough people within Iraq that would like that kind of -- there may be a nationalist government, a government that really honors the Iraqi history and the Iraqi traditions and Iraq, itself. But it must be a government that is going to, you know, represents all the people. And I believe that can happen. Q Were you surprised by the degree of looting that occurred almost instantly? THE PRESIDENT: No, I wasn't surprised at all. Q You were not? Why? THE PRESIDENT: I mean, these were people that hated the regime under which they lived. Q But they went after hospitals and museums and -- THE PRESIDENT: I don't like that part. And that was the -- you know, the hospitals and museum were the absolute worst part. The good news is, is that the hospitals are now up and running, they've got enough medical supplies to take care of the people that need help. That museum was a terrible incident. I couldn't agree more with people who say we're sorry that happened. We are, by the way, helping find treasure, restore treasure and we'll provide all the expertise and help they need to get that museum up and running again. But I wasn't surprised. It was vengeance, because it's like uncorking a bottle of frustration. These are people whose relatives were beaten, tortured, shocked, killed because they spoke out, because they disagreed with Saddam Hussein. And history is going to show how brutal this man and his sons and his regime really, really was. And, therefore, it did not surprise me when people took vengeance on police stations, or took, you know, went out into government buildings and destroyed them. I'm also pleased by the fact that that level of -- those riots, or whatever you want to call them, released some steam, and now life is returning to normal. Things have settled down inside the country. Q There's still a lot of nationalism, though. I mean, it's a very strong strain there and, in fact, some people are taking control of their neighborhoods, or whole sectors of Baghdad -- THE PRESIDENT: Yes, like the guy, the self-proclaimed mayor. Q Right. THE PRESIDENT: This is all -- a reasonable government will evolve. We just started. It wasn't but two weeks ago yesterday that the statue fell down. There have been 20-plus years of tyranny. And it's hard to believe that in 20 days democracy will emerge. But the point we're making is, is that the foundation for democracy is now being laid. And the -- and by the way, there's nothing wrong with nationalism within Iraq. People say the United States should leave, and we want to leave -- as soon as we've accomplished our mission. Q How long will that take? THE PRESIDENT: Somebody asked me the other day, how long is it going to take to get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime? My answer is, as long as necessary. Q But it may take as long as two years -- THE PRESIDENT: It could. It could. Or less, who knows? But the point I'm making is, is that we are there to promote security, to make sure life returns back to normal. And to help the Iraqi people establish a government, because we believe that democracy can work within Iraq. And nationalism, by the way, you know, means it's more likely that a government will evolve that is focused on Iraq, its traditions and its history, as opposed to focusing on a particular religion. Q Is Iran trying to take root in southern Iraq, in your judgment? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, you hear a lot of reports about the vacuums being filled by Iranian agents. We certainly hope that Iraq -- Iran will allow Iraq to develop into a stable and peaceful society. We have sent the word to the Iranians that that's what we expect. I talk to Tony Blair and Jose Maria Aznar on a regular basis -- talked to them yesterday, and this subject came up. And both of them have got contacts with the Iranian government and they will send the same message, similar to what we did to Syria: that we expect there to be cooperation and -- Q And if there is not, is Iran next? THE PRESIDENT: No, we just expect them to cooperate, and we will work with the world to encourage them to cooperate. We have no military plans. Just like I said about Syria. I mean, listen, the world, a lot of the -- frankly, the left wing critics of our policy have said, you know, these people are so militaristic they're getting ready to invade Syria. That was the line of the day. We made it clear to the Syrians we expect them to cooperate. Q And are they responding? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think they are. They're doing a better job. The borders look like they're tighter. As we find people that have escaped into Syria, we're giving the Syrian government the names of the people. And they appear to want to be helpful. Q Let me ask you about the future of some other relationships that we have, with the United Nations, for example. There are two people who admire you very much and are powerful pundits in Washington. George Will and Bill Kristol have said of the U.N., George Will saying: if it's not the end as we know it, it should be. And Bill Kristol has said: the U.N. I used to think was just useless, now I think is harmful. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would hope that the U.N. would be useful. I would hope that the U.N. would be an effective body at helping deal with the new threats of the 21st century, dealing with terror and terrorist states and proliferation of weapons. And I can understand why some are frustrated with the United Nations, because the United Nations looked like it was not willing to join in the cause of freedom. And it was frustrating to Americans that it looked like the United Nations might hold up U.S. foreign policy that was being conducted in the name of peace and security. On the other hand, I was the person that went to the United Nations in the first place. It was my decision to go give the speech on September 12, 2002, that called the United Nations to account. The United Nations will have a useful role in the reconstruction of Iraq, for example, because a lot of nations won't be able give reconstruction money without a U.N. conduit. And there is a role in this case for the United Nations. I hope as threats emerge the United Nations will be more responsive to those threats. Q Are you going to invite French President Chirac to the ranch in Crawford? THE PRESIDENT: Well, my first guest will be John Howard -- well, first guest from this moment forward will be John Howard, and he's coming -- Q The Prime Minister of Australia? THE PRESIDENT: The Prime Minister of Australia, he's a great friend and a wonderful ally, will be coming a week from Friday. Q Well, what about President Chirac, though? THE PRESIDENT: You really -- you're really not going to get any comment. I doubt he'll be coming to the ranch any time soon. On the other hand, you know, there are some strains in the relationship, obviously, because of -- it appeared to some in our administration and our country that the French position was anti-American. And my concern about the French position is it would weaken -- the position they took could weaken the NATO alliance. NATO is a very important alliance; it's something that we've not only worked to modernize, I've worked to expand NATO. And it's very important that Europe not become fractured, to the point where the United States won't have relations with a united Europe whole, free and at peace. And, hopefully, the past tensions will subside and the French won't be using their position within Europe to create alliances against the United States, or Britain or Spain or any of the new countries that are the new democracies in Europe. Q We've talked about this before. Now that the war in Iraq is effectively over, have you thought about a Bush doctrine that is a comprehensive structure of some kind, on a global basis, for dealing with weapons of mass destruction and the need, even, of preemptive strikes against rogue nations? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Bush doctrine is actually being defined by action, as opposed to by words. Although, I think if you compile a lot of the speeches I've given, you could come up with the Bush doctrine. The way I view the post-Saddam Iraq opportunities are these, one, that we can deal more effectively with weapons of mass destruction, that we made it clear that people who harbor weapons of mass destruction will be dealt with. Hopefully, most of it can be done diplomatically. And you'll see us -- see me, as well as members of my administration, begin to push for new international protocols that will make international organizations more effective at stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I also believe that reform in the Middle East, as well as Middle East peace, is an initiative that we will continue to -- that I will push, and push -- particularly in the Middle East peace process, I will work hard to achieve the two-state solution. And we have a good opportunity to do so. There are other parts of the Bush doctrine, if you want to call it that, that are equally important. One, the AIDS initiative in Africa is an incredibly important initiative and I intend to call upon Europe, particularly the wealthier nations in Europe, to join us in providing the medicines, the anti-retroviral drugs and the strategies necessary to start saving lives, more lives on the continent of Africa. There's a lot of things where we can work together, is my point, to overcome any differences that might have existed on the Iraq policy. Q Before the war began, we were told by any number of people in your administration that a lot of the leaders of the Middle East were privately saying: we hope that you get rid of Saddam Hussein. Once the war was over, they did not go public with praise for the United States -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, our best friends in that region. While on the Arab street, there continue to be very strong criticism to what we were doing. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I can understand that. I mean, these guys -- first of all, the thing that was important with those countries is they provided us help when we asked for help. We needed basing help in certain countries, and they provided it. That was one of the reasons why were successful against Saddam Hussein. We asked, and they delivered. Part of the frustrations that exist in the Middle East -- and I recognize this -- is the fact that there is no movement toward peace with the Palestinians. Part of the frustration in the Middle East is also the fact that some of these governments need to enact reforms, and that's why both reform and working on the Middle East for peace will be priorities of mine. Q Is the Middle East peace process going to accelerate greatly now that Arafat has accepted a Prime Minister? And has Arafat been removed effectively from the equation? THE PRESIDENT: I think it will accelerate, and, hopefully, greatly. I'm not so sure what that exactly means, but it will certainly accelerate from where we are today. The selection of Abu Mazen as the Prime Minster is very positive, primarily because Abu Mazen has stated publicly that he is against terror and will use whatever powers he has to fight off the terrorist activities that have really prevented peace from moving forward. In my June 24th speech I laid out -- Q Will you have him to the White House without Arafat, for example? THE PRESIDENT: I will one of these days, yes. Q Without Arafat? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, absolutely. Listen, I always felt -- first of all, I looked at the history of Mr. Arafat. Now, I saw what he did to President Clinton. There was no need to spend capital, unless you had an interlocutor who could deliver the Palestinian people toward peace. And I believe Abu Mazen is a man dedicated to peace, and I look forward to working with him for the two-state solution. My view is, is that the only way for there to be peace and for the survival of Israel and for the hope of the Palestinian people is for two states living side by side in peace. And I've laid out a plan to achieve that, a plan that calls upon actions by the Israelis, by the Palestinians, as well as by the Arab nations surrounding that troubled part of the world. Q There used to be an American doctrine about when we go to war it's overwhelming force. Now it's speed and flexibility, based on Iraq, and instant communication -- not only behind the scenes, but everybody gets to look in on the battlefield. THE PRESIDENT: Well, the instant communications part was one of the reasons why I was comfortable in giving Tommy Franks and the commanders in the field the go-ahead to take the shot at Saddam Hussein on the first day. Because there in the Oval Office we were getting near instant feedback from eyes on the ground what he was seeing, what he felt the conditions were like. It was an amazing moment to think that a person risking his life, viewing the farms, watching the entries, seeing, observing what was taking place inside one of Saddam's most guarded facilities, was able to pick up a device, call CENTCOM, and CENTCOM would call us in near real-time. And the ability to communicate has changed the nature of warfare. It allows for more interoperability; more ability for the Navy and the Air Force and the Special Ops and the Army and the Marines to work side by side in a coordinated basis. Which makes it easier to fight a war with flexibility and speed and precision. So the doctrine really has changed. As well, it's an amazing concept when you think about real-time TV focusing on war. And by the way, I express -- Laura and I express our deepest sympathies to David Bloom's wife and his family. I knew him well during the campaign, he was a great journalist and really a good fellow, loved his family a lot but, you know, to think that David was there -- Q Rocketing across the desert. THE PRESIDENT -- rocketing across the desert. It's an amazing feeling. Q I don't want you to give up sources and methods, but the guy who called in the first time -- still with us? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, he is. He is with us. Thank God. A brave soul. Q That's great. 11:47 P.M. EDT * * * * * 2:45 P.M. EDT Q Listen, now that the war in Iraq is over, the whole country is turning its attention back to the economy -- and there's -- on the Hill, in your own party, there's a lot of skepticism about whether or not the tax cuts can get the job done. You started at $750 billion; you've now been talking about $550 billion; the Senate is talking about $350 billion. Would you take $350 billion? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it ought to be -- actually, I think it ought to be more robust, and the reason why is because a lot of economists have told me that the tax cut needs to be sizeable enough to affect demand and job creation. And that's why I'm pushing what I'm pushing, and I'm not going to quit pushing until they end up voting. I believe it's the right thing. The American people need to know that last January I put out a job plan, and the Congress has been debating it, talking about it. And it was important in January, it's important now. And I expect them to get a good jobs bill out. Q The Congressional Budget Office, however, says, you know, they've looked at with three or four different models and it's just going to be too small in terms of the impact on the overall economy. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I disagree with that. I would like -- I would hope that they would argue the case on the floor of the Senate before (inaudible) the skeptics. One of the things they also said was it's very important to hold the line on spending -- that's another thing, that we accomplished something in the budget, discretionary spending is being held to about 4 percent. On the spending side we've got restraint, we just need to make sure the package is robust enough to create new jobs so people can find work. Q It's tough to come out here to Ohio, though. You've got a Republican governor who went in at a very high number, and now he's down to around 42 percent, in terms of approval rating; he's having to raise taxes, cut services. Wouldn't it be better to defer a little bit, get him off the hook? And these are important services that he's talking about -- it's about Medicaid and -- THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. Actually, what's important is -- and this is the reason we come to Ohio, it's a place where people are looking for work. And I feel so strongly that my job package will work, I'm willing to come to a place where people need work. And so let's get this done in the Congress. And this is the perfect place to bring a message of job creation, because there are people here that -- in the manufacturing sector, in particular -- that are looking for work. Q Mr. President, I've been struck by the fact that you now have the country's attention and there's been almost no discussion about the need for conservation on energy and finding renewable sources and making that the highest of the high priorities. I think the country is ready to make a sacrifice, to do something. THE PRESIDENT: Well, actually, there's been a significant discussion about new sources of energy. I was the guy that stood in front of Congress and asked Congress to appropriate $1.2 billion to advance the hyrdogen automobile. In other words -- as well as ask Congress to appropriate monies to explore the opportunities for nuclear fusion. And I believe that instead of getting mired in this talk about command and control and lawsuits and regulations, that we ought to use our technological capabilities to leapfrog the status quo, and lead the world to a more energy efficient society. Q But should we also assume that we can burn at the same rate that we have been? And, you know, there's just no question about it, we've been on an energy consumption binge. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, that's right. And I think that that's why we need new technologies to help us go from one era -- a hydrocarbon era -- to a technologically-driven era. And I believe we can get there. We've got energy for, you know, a decade or two, without the consumer suffering badly. But now is the time to move on new technologies. This is precisely the initiative I laid out for Congress. Q You're not going to get the Arctic Wildlife Refuge this time, though, do you think? THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's foolish not to, in my judgment. There's a lot of natural gas up there. And the reason we need natural gas here in America is so places like California built a lot of electrical plants that run on natural gas -- we've got to get it from somewhere. And I believe we can explore in the Arctic Wildlife in an environmentally sensitive way -- and so do a lot of other people. But it's become such a political issue. Washington, you know, is a town that -- you know this better than me, I mean -- Q No, I don't know it better than you. You're in the cockpit. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, you've been there longer than me, you're much older than I am. (Laughter.) But they take an issue and turn it into such high politics. Really, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge is a classic example of an issue that's been over-politicized, where the science never is allowed to emerge. We can drill for natural gas, which we need to do, in an environmentally safe way. Q Let me ask you about the war and your attitudes about it. It's well known that you're a man of very strong faith. You have political and national security responsibilities, as well. Was there a time when it was difficult to reconcile those two roles -- your political and national security responsibility and your own spiritual obligation? THE PRESIDENT: Well, listen, any time you think about committing someone into combat is an emotional moment. You can't be detached from the human life involved with war. And I genuinely feel that the decision I made will make America more secure. And I felt like the risks of doing nothing, the risk of taking no action far exceeded the risks of combat, particularly since I knew our plan was geared toward minimizing life -- minimizing loss of life -- not only minimizing loss of life on our side, but on the side of the innocent Iraqis. I don't bring God into my life to be a political person; I ask God for strength and guidance; I ask God to help me be a better decision. The decision about war and peace is a decision I made based upon what I thought were the best interests of the American people. I was able to step back from religion, because I have a job to do. And I, on bended knee to the good Lord, asked Him to help me to do my job in a way that that's wise. Q I had a difficult moment on the air when the mother of a Marine who got killed called in -- and wanted to talk about her son. And said: you know, I like what the networks are doing, but all those graphics and all that fancy coverage, for those of us who are out here with children's in harm's way, it's murderous, Mr. Brokaw. And it put it all in perspective. Did you have a moment like that? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I think, yes, maybe about the day the prisoners, the people took the wrong turn, the kids, the cooks and the people like that from El Paso, Fort Bliss, went the wrong way. That was a tough day. And it's got to be -- listen, I went down to Camp Lejeune and met with family of -- who lost their lives. I met a young lieutenant's wife with a young baby. And it's tough. The amazing thing is, of course -- I shouldn't say ""of course"" -- but the amazing thing about meeting those people is they gave me great strength. They were proud of their loved ones' sacrifice; they understood why we were there. And they were strong, really strong. Q There was a young Marine who was killed whose father in Baltimore held up his picture and said: I want the President to see this; it's my only son and I want the President to see this picture. He was opposed to the war. Did you see it? THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't see that, but I'm sure I can understand why a dad would feel that way. I would feel the same way if I were a dad about how miserable I felt if I lost my son. Q Can you imagine being FDR and running World War II all those years? Truman, Korea? All the years that Vietnam went on and 57,000 lives were lost. THE PRESIDENT: I know. Q Now that you've had your own -- THE PRESIDENT: One month. Q -- one month, but your own time on the crucible, to know what the country would go through? THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting question, because -- yes, I know, I can't imagine what it would be like to have been through the Vietnam War as the President of the United States. I hope I would have done it differently, I hope I would have had a clearer mission and given the militaries the tools and their strategy necessary to achieve a mission, as opposed to politicizing the war the way they did. But you're right, it's a strain on the country. On the other hand, the coverage was a little different. Q It was. THE PRESIDENT: The perpetual moves 24 hours a day. Q And part of that was, by the way, that it became very emotional very quickly. One of the things that you said was that you wanted to liberate the Iraqi people so they could speak their minds. But in this country, when some people spoke their minds when it happened to be in opposition of the war, they got jumped on by a lot of folks. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I don't think so. Q Well, the Dixie Chicks, for example. Would you have them come to the White House? THE PRESIDENT: I mean, the Dixie Chicks are free to speak their mind. They can say what they want to say. And just because -- they shouldn't have their feelings hurt just because some people don't want to buy their records when they speak out. You know, freedom is a two-way street. But I have -- don't really care what the Dixie Chicks said. I want to do what I think is right for the American people, and if some singers or Hollywood stars feel like speaking out, that's fine. That's the great thing about America. It stands in stark contrast to Iraq, by the way. Q What did you and Laura talk about at the end of the day? During Osama bin Laden she was counseling you on your language -- (laughter) -- saying -- THE PRESIDENT: It wasn't so every day. (Laughter.) Q -- Georgie, you don't have to say ""wanted dead or alive."" THE PRESIDENT: Well, she counsels me on a lot of things. Most of the time it's -- but who's going to listen. She understood all along why I was making decisions I was making. She understood the threat that Iraq posed. She understood that Iraq was a part of the war on terror. And she doesn't -- she's like a lot of people, she was nervous about war. Q So was your dad, by the way. THE PRESIDENT: I'm sure he was. Nobody likes wars. Q Did your dad talk to you every day? THE PRESIDENT: No. I check-in with him on occasion but, now, we don't talk every day. Q How about Barbara, what does she have to say, your mother? THE PRESIDENT: She's as feisty as ever. She's doing well. She doesn't follow everything in the news and the opinion like Dad does; he's an every word man. Q Do you seek his counsel? It's a little tricky. Here's your father, somebody that you revered and love, and he's been there before. But at the same time, you're now the President. How do you work that out? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I really don't spend a lot of time hashing over policy with him. He knows that I am much better informed than he could possibly be. He gives me -- our relationship is more of, and our conversations are more along the line of a dad and a son, a dad conveying to his son how much he loves him. Which is important, even at the age of 56 years old it's important. Q Did you call him the day the statue came down of Saddam Hussein? THE PRESIDENT: I can't remember. Q Because that was a memorable day. THE PRESIDENT: It was. It was. Q Did you watch all that? THE PRESIDENT: I watched some of it. As you know, I've got a schedule to keep; I don't have time to sit around watching TV all day long. But somebody -- I think the Ashley or Blake said, the statue, they're about to get it down. They had a guy hammering on it for a while, and I watched the hammering -- Q It took a while to pull it down. THE PRESIDENT: I watched them hammer. And then they said, they're hooking it up and they've got the crane out there. And I said, well, let me know. They said, well, it's about to come down. So I hustled and then watched it. Q And what about the Iraqi information minister? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: He's my man, he was great. (Laughter.) Somebody accused us of hiring him and putting him there. He was a classic. Q Al-Sahhaf. THE PRESIDENT: Al-Sahhaf. Q He said: we are repulsing them at the airport, this war is just about over. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: He was great. (Laughter.) Q Did you watch him actually? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I did watch some of his clips. You know, a lot of the stuff I get, people come in and report to me -- did you hear what so-and-so said, or, did you see that? So I get a lot of things secondhand. But in the case of the statue or Sahhaf, somebody would say, he's getting ready to speak, and I'd pop out of a meeting or turn and watch the TV. Q And did they tell you when Saddam made those bizarre video appearances very late in the war, when he was said to be walking around the neighborhood -- THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I saw some of that. Like, Condi will come in and say -- I'll pick up the phone, I've got direct link now -- I'll say, well, Condi, what is this business about, what does the Agency say about this latest videotape. She'll pop in and say, you know, I talked to Tenet and Tenet says our analysts can't imagine that the guy could possibly be alive, walking around Baghdad the same day the statue came down. You know, as I told you, we had some evidence early on that strikes from the first day may have gotten him. I say ""may"" because we don't have the DNA in hand to prove, and people really don't want to be in a position, Tom, where you make -- broadcasting success and then all of a sudden Saddam Hussein shows up somewhere. According to this one eyewitness, he's not going to show up anywhere. Q Final question. You still have two big issues out there on the horizon: al Qaeda and North Korea. North Korea today saying that it's reprocessed 8,000 plutonium rods and if you don't start talking to them, they're willing to sell them. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. See, they're back to the old blackmail game. One of our goals and objectives must be to strengthen the nonproliferation regimes and get the whole world focused on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the materials for weapons of mass destruction, and North Korea is making my case, that we've got to come together. And we started that process in the North Korean peninsula that is coming together. The Chinese now, for the first time, are partners at the table. I look forward to hearing what the Chinese say about being rebuffed by the North Koreans because they, too, believe that the Peninsula ought to be nuclear weapons-free. This will give us an opportunity to say to the North Koreans and the world we're not going to be threatened. ON the other hand we, the world, must come together to make sure institutions like the IAEA are effective at stopping proliferation. It's another reason, by the way for us to also advance the missile defense systems, because the missile defense system will make it less likely that a nuclear country could blackmail us or Japan or any one of our friends. Q And al Qaeda? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we're on the hunt on al Qaeda. Q Has it diminished 50 percent, 70 percent? THE PRESIDENT: I can't give you a number, but it's certainly diminished. And Kalid Sheik Mohammed's arrest, right before the Iraqi war, was a blow to the al Qaeda network. They're still moving around, and we're watching. And we're moving. We're cutting off money. There are some parts of Afghanistan where we think some are hiding, and we've got -- we're on their trail. The other day, for example, in the Situation Room, we had Tommy up and he gave us a briefing on Iraq. He's the CENTCOM commander, as you know, also responsible for Afghanistan, and then the general in place in Afghanistan came up. So we split the briefing between Iraq and Afghanistan. And it was an important briefing because he was telling us troop strength and troop strategies, as well as how well the country is beginning to get on its feet. But the point I'm trying to make is, is that we are constantly moving against al Qaeda in Afghanistan as we speak, or as we conduct the Iraq theater. Q Mr. President, thank you very much for your time today, we really appreciate it. THE PRESIDENT: I enjoyed it. Q Thank you. I enjoyed it a lot."
USA_Doc4_Interv_Dom,"MR. REEKER: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back to the State Department on this fine Monday afternoon. In a short time, Secretary Powell will depart for Europe and Eurasia, his first stop, of course, Bucharest, where he will be attending tomorrow the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's ministerial meeting, which is taking place today and tomorrow, the annual gathering of foreign ministers of the OSCE, and expect the participants there to issue a statement addressing a number of the issues that OSCE has been involved with, as well as their action plan to combat global terrorism. So that will be the first step in the Secretary's eight-day tour. Ambassador Boucher, of course, is accompanying the Secretary. So I am here without any other announcements to take your questions. QUESTION: Did the Secretary ever consider not going on this trip because of developments in the Middle East? MR. REEKER: Not that I'm aware of. I think this trip has been planned. As you know, he met yesterday -- along with the President, of course -- with Prime Minister Sharon, when that meeting was moved up, allowing the Prime Minister to return to Israel. QUESTION: To follow that, is there any thought that he might go to the Middle East as part of this trip? MR. REEKER: Not that I am aware of. There are, I believe, 10 stops that were announced in the notice we released last week. None of those are in the Middle East. So 10 stops in eight days. QUESTION: I assume that you were watching at least the beginning of the White House briefing, as were we. A couple of things I wanted to get out I'm not clear on. First of all, does the President -- does the United States believe that Israel has the right to defend itself? MR. REEKER: Yes. QUESTION: And does the United States believe that the situation in the Middle East right now is complicated and fluid? MR. REEKER: Yes, Matt. QUESTION: Now that I got that straight, Prime Minister Sharon in his address made a big point saying that President Bush had told him that -- he was telling the Israelis about what the President had told him, Sharon, yesterday. And he said -- he told the Israeli people that the United States was a partner with Israel in its fight against terrorism. Is that your -- MR. REEKER: I will have to let the White House speak to what the President said in the meeting that was at the White House, that was the President's meeting. Certainly, let me start by echoing the statements that the President made as well as Secretary Powell and General Zinni over the weekend, in terms of condemning the horrific acts of murder which were committed in Jerusalem and Haifa. All of our leaders have expressed their sympathies on that and I think made quite clear our message, as Secretary Powell said, that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must act immediately to bring violence and terrorism to an end through immediate, comprehensive and sustained action by the Palestinian Authority against both the individuals responsible and the infrastructure of the groups that support them. QUESTION: Right. But -- I'll do this one more time and then, if you don't answer it, I'll assume that I'm going to get nowhere and I'll drop it. MR. REEKER: Thank you for that admission. (Laughter.) QUESTION: Sharon said specifically that the United States was a partner with Israel in this fight against terrorism there. Is that true? MR. REEKER: We certainly are fighting terror. We discuss that every day. As you know, we are quite involved in terrorism; we have been for a long time, and particularly since we were attacked on September the 11th, as the President has said, we have focused all the resources of the United States Government in the war against terrorism. As you know, we are involved in Afghanistan, where we are focused right now on seeking out and cutting off the al-Qaida network, Usama bin Laden and the Taliban that have protected him. Terrorism has got to stop. And we have made that point very clear. You can't pick and choose terrorists. That's the message that we have given to the Palestinian Authority, as I just indicated, and as the Secretary said, and as the President has said, Chairman Arafat is responsible for taking steps to stop the violence, and there has to be sustained action by the Palestinian Authority against those individuals responsible. They need to bring them to justice, but they also need to take action against the infrastructure of those groups that supports those individuals. And there is absolutely no excuse for failure to take immediate and thorough action. QUESTION: A couple quickies. MR. REEKER: Quickies. QUESTION: Do you agree with Prime Minister Sharon's assessment that Arafat is responsible for the terrorism? MR. REEKER: We agree that Chairman Arafat is responsible for taking steps to stop the violence, as I just said. We have made that abundantly clear. I think the Secretary underscored over the weekend that the terrorist attacks that occurred were direct attacks against Chairman Arafat's control. QUESTION: So it's not -- MR. REEKER: And the Palestinian Authority, he needs to respond, as I said, not just by arresting the perpetrators, which is necessary, but also by taking action to ensure that the organizations responsible -- some of them have claimed responsibility -- are unable to commit further acts of such terror. And we continue to work with the parties. General Zinni remains in the region, available to work with the parties to achieve a real cease-fire, which is the paramount focus now in moving forward on this. As the Secretary said, it's a moment of truth for Mr. Arafat. QUESTION: And if I can follow up. Does the State Department still oppose what you have called a policy of targeted killings? MR. REEKER: No change in that policy. QUESTION: There has been no change. So is that -- is it fair to say that the US would oppose Israeli actions as the one last -- MR. REEKER: Eli, I have nothing new for you on this. QUESTION: Well, I'm not asking for something new. I'm asking you now, there have been changes since the Sharon meeting; there was a big speech. I'm saying, right now, the State Department still opposes any action the Israelis would take in terms of ending certain terrorists on the ground there? MR. REEKER: I'm not going to agree with your words and your interpretations in trying to interpret our words. What I'm going to tell you is that there is no change in our policies. QUESTION: (Inaudible) that Chairman Arafat must dismantle the infrastructure behind these attacks. What then do you think of the Israeli strategy, which seems to be in fact to attack the very structure of Arafat, which might be useful in undermining (inaudible) structure of the terrorists? MR. REEKER: As the President has said, as Secretary Powell has made quite clear, Israel is responsible for providing security for its citizens. And we understand Israel's needs to take decisions regarding its self-defense. Our view on that has not changed. It is important, we think that whatever actions are taken, that all parties consider carefully the repercussions of their actions, so that peace can still be achieved. And I think Secretary Powell made quite clear again on the weekend that we say, as we always have, that the parties should always consider what happens the day after and the day after that. As he said, we'll keep making our efforts, keep trying to help achieve a cease-fire, because that's the most important step to move forward. QUESTION: And if I can have a follow-up. Does the United States still consider Chairman Arafat to be a partner for peace? And will General Zinni be having meetings with him in the next few days? MR. REEKER: I can't give you an exact readout on what General Zinni will be doing. He is remaining in the region, however, and expect him to have contact with Israeli officials, with Palestinian officials. That is what he is there for, that is what he has been charged by the President and the Secretary of State to do. So he will be in contact. He will be available, because we intend to keep trying to help achieve the cease-fire. And we do think, as I said, that Chairman Arafat can do more, needs to do more, must make the sustained 100 percent effort that we have called for, as the Secretary has described. QUESTION: Is he still a partner for peace, as you have often described him? MR. REEKER: I think we have called on Chairman Arafat to take those steps. He can take those steps to help get a cease-fire so that we can move forward with the Mitchell Committee report, which will lead us back onto the road toward peace. QUESTION: Can you tell us what General Zinni has been doing in the last four hours? MR. REEKER: I can't. I know that he is in the region and he has been in touch, certainly, with our diplomats in the region. But I don't have an exact breakdown. QUESTION: Three very elemental things, easy. Last call we know that Powell made was to -- except for the Turkish and the Greek ministers, which are on another subject -- was to Fischer. Have there been any more contacts, number one? Have you heard anything from the Arab world since this campaign got underway? And we know the obvious, but I would like you to state it so we don't have to do it. The Secretary is off to Bucharest. He is going to such distant places as Kazakhstan, I think, maybe -- MR. REEKER: No, he has announced that. QUESTION: All right, I shouldn't say that -- MR. REEKER: He has announced that and we have put out a statement. Yes. QUESTION: But he is going to various places. So how does he stay on top of this? MR. REEKER: If I can -- QUESTION: Could you do a list of calls from the weekend? Thanks. MR. REEKER: If I can remember, the first question was about calls from the weekend. On Saturday, I think, the Secretary already told you all -- those that were watching the Sunday shows -- that he spoke with Chairman Arafat on Saturday. He also spoke with the Foreign Minister of Ecuador, Foreign Minister Moeller. On Sunday, he spoke with Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany, with Mr. Cem, with Mr. Papandreou, and with Mr. Solana on Sunday. I am not aware of any calls today to give you. The next question was his travel? As I described at the beginning, and I think I could run you through the stops, we did put out a notice that listed all of the stops, I believe 10, starting with Bucharest where he will arrive tomorrow morning. The Secretary will also visit Turkey. He will visit Brussels where he will meet at the ministerial level with his colleagues and counterparts from the other NATO member countries. Of course, he will be seeing Foreign Minister Ivanov of Russia at both stops. He will then go on, as you indicated, Barry, to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan. And then expect him to be in Moscow and then, without any particular order, Berlin, Paris and London. QUESTION: Okay, but -- MR. REEKER: How will he keep in touch? QUESTION: Yes, you know, mechanically -- MR. REEKER: Very carefully. QUESTION: Yes, I know, but he's a little bit not in the big tent right now. MR. REEKER: We have a very big tent, Barry, and our tent includes excellent communications. The Secretary will be in regular contact, obviously, with his team back here, with his team in the field, with the President as necessary, and clearly with any foreign leaders that he needs to be in touch with. QUESTION: Have you gotten any initial reaction from the Arabs or the Europeans or anybody? MR. REEKER: I know there have been conversations with other officials, not with the Secretary, with our officials at our embassies. I just don't have any particular readout on any of those. I know we will be in regular touch. QUESTION: With the repeated calls for Arafat to do more, it seems to me as though you do not believe that Arafat is beyond redemption, there is still a way for him to take the steps that are necessary? That's correct? I mean, this seems a little bit at odds with what Prime Minister Sharon was implying, in that Arafat has made a strategic choice in favor of terrorism, in favor of slaughtering innocent citizens, is what he said. MR. REEKER: I think I will have to let Prime Minister Sharon speak for himself. QUESTION: But you guys don't believe that Arafat is beyond -- MR. REEKER: I think the Secretary was quite clear yesterday in saying that he believes that Chairman Arafat can show leadership, can exercise his authority and can take the steps as part of a 100 percent effort to arrest the perpetrators of the heinous crimes from the weekend and, as I said, to take action against the organizations, the infrastructure that allows those groups to carry out terrorist activities. And we believe that he can do that, that take further action, can do more than he has done. QUESTION: Can he then lead the Palestinian Authority back into peace talks with the Israelis? MR. REEKER: That will obviously be a decision for the Palestinians. He is the leader of the Palestinian Authority. There is a roadmap for both sides to move back into a more positive direction. But first of all, they've got to get the violence down. QUESTION: But as far as you're concerned, Arafat is still -- it is still possible for there to be talks between a Palestinian Authority led by Arafat and an Israeli Government led by whoever? MR. REEKER: I think as the Secretary said, we believe Arafat can take steps -- QUESTION: No, no. MR. REEKER: -- and they have -- Matt, let me finish -- and they have a road map to move forward. It's the parties that will have to decide what steps they can take, but both of them have agree to the outline of the Mitchell Plan. QUESTION: Right. Well, let me ask it this way, you don't believe that it's a lost cause? MR. REEKER: No. We believe that peace can still be achieved. We think that is why it is important that whatever actions the parties take, they have got to consider the repercussions, they have got to look at what happens the day after and the day after that, as the Secretary has said. Because there has got to be a movement towards peace so that all the people of the region can live more peacefully, so that their children and grandchildren will have a better opportunity. QUESTION: Do you believe that Arafat -- does the government believe that Arafat actually has controlled these groups, and/or knows of their activities, who they are, where they are, et cetera? And does the government believe Arafat can survive? MR. REEKER: We believe that Chairman Arafat can take steps, can take greater effort to bring individuals responsible for these crimes to justice and take steps beyond arresting the perpetrators of these acts, but take action against the organization responsible for supporting them. As the Secretary said, these attacks over the weekend were also direct attacks against Chairman Arafat's control, and against the Palestinian Authority. And he needs to respond. He needs to show true leadership. All of those need to realize that this is a moment of truth for Chairman Arafat, and it's time for him now to show his leadership, and to take those steps. QUESTION: So you believe that he knows who these people are and where they are? MR. REEKER: We believe that he can work with his authorities, with his officials. He can work with the Israelis on security matters. We have helped create structures through the Tenet work plan. We have General Zinni available for justice (inaudible) to share information, to work together to bring those responsible to justice and to tear down the networks that allow that type of terrorism to take place. QUESTION: In regard to General Zinni, over the weekend, a bunch of Israelis were shouting and booing at him. Do you think that he still has the ability to work, that they trust him, that they trust his role? MR. REEKER: General Zinni is an envoy of the President of the United States, and the Secretary of State of the United States. He is there to keep trying to help achieve a peace. He is there to do whatever we can, on behalf of the United States, to help the parties first of all to get the violence down, to bring forward a cease-fire so that when the violence stops, the parties can move in to the path that they have all agreed to, to head towards a negotiation, political discussion that can move forward in the outlines of the Mitchell Committee Report. Definitely. QUESTION: -- some authority that could be exercised and has a chance -- MR. REEKER: Absolutely, and he remains in the region to work with the parties and to be available to them to help do what I just described. QUESTION: In the wake of the incidents over the weekend, do you see Zinni's role as changing in any way? At one point he was there to try to facilitate security cooperation, along those lines. Do you see him more as like doing more immediate crisis management? Or is his role exactly the same? MR. REEKER: Well, I think it still boils down to the same thing, the need to have a cease-fire, to end the violence, to get the violence down, and General Zinni, as well as our embassy and our consulate, are in ongoing contacts with Israeli officials, with Palestinian leaders, to help the parties achieve a durable cease-fire, and that's what they will continue to do. QUESTION: Phil, two tangentially related questions. MR. REEKER: Uh-oh. QUESTION: The first one, considering what this government -- the President the Secretary of State and others -- have said about the fight against terrorism, how are you able to urge restraint on the Israelis? Or are you urging restraint on the Israelis? And the second question is, if you don't obtain some sort of restraint on the part of the Israelis, what does that do to the Arab members of the other coalition against al-Qaida? MR. REEKER: Well, I will ask you not to particularly put words into my mouth that weren't there, but our views have not changed on that. As I said, Israeli is responsible for providing security for its citizens, and we certainly understand -- the President has said he understands, the Secretary understands Israel's need to take decisions regarding is self-defense. To repeat what I said, it's important, we believe, that whatever actions are taken, that all parties consider the repercussions of those actions so that peace can still be achieved. And again, to quote the Secretary, to always consider what happens the say after and the day after that. We're going to keep trying to help achieve a cease-fire. That's what we want to do. But we think that both sides need to keep these things in mind, and they need to take, in the case of Chairman Arafat, the actions that we have described right now. QUESTION: Assuming that the Israelis are in fact thinking about what would happen after that, and if they take the sort of action that looks like they are taking now, can they claim the United States gave them a green light? MR. REEKER: No, I think my colleague at the White House was very clear on that. There was no green light asked for, there was no green light given. This isn't a game of Red-Light-Green-Light. This is about getting a cease-fire, an end to the violence that will allow the sides to move forward. And it means an end to terrorism, it means Chairman Arafat taking the steps which he has promised to do to bring to justice those responsible. But, again, to chop out the infrastructure, as we have talked about so much in recent weeks, of those organizations that plan and allow these heinous attacks against civilians to take place. QUESTION: I'm not sure I understood your first answer to my question. Are you saying the United States is not urging restraint on the Israelis? MR. REEKER: I don't think we have had any change in our view. What we are saying is we understand Israel is responsible for their security and that they need to take the decisions regarding self-defense that they take. But again, we are urging all parties to consider repercussions of their action and always look to the next day and the day after that. QUESTION: when you say ""chop out the infrastructure,"" I mean, that would entail a significant level of intelligence, a significant level of security forces. Is the United States -- do you think he actually has the -- Arafat has the ability to essentially chop them out, so to say, and do you see the United States helping in that regard? MR. REEKER: We believe that Chairman Arafat can take additional steps, that he can make a 100 percent effort to have sustained action under his leadership by the Palestinian Authority against those individuals responsible and the infrastructure of the groups that support them. I mean, this didn't happen in a vacuum. And the individuals, part of these terrorist groups, need to be brought to justice, those that are still around, and he needs to take steps to shut down the terrorist networks that can allow that to happen. We are there in the region to help with security, to help with this type of thing, to allow both sides to work together to facilitate what they have both said is their aim, and that is to end this violence and to move into the Mitchell Committee process. And so, to that extent, as I said, General Zinni remains there, our consulate and our embassy very much in touch to help both sides however we can. QUESTION: If I could follow up, the actual process -- it is one thing to make arrests of specific individuals. But the actual rooting out and destroying the infrastructure of these groups is fairly detailed and some experts that watch the region have suggested that in terms of infrastructure, that Arafat's apparatus might not be able to do that -- MR. REEKER: I think there is a -- QUESTION: Can I finish? -- would the United States be willing to help Chairman Arafat root out the infrastructure of these groups? MR. REEKER: Elise, as I have said a dozen times already now, we are willing to help bring about a cease-fire, get the violence down. We're there. We provide our good offices to take the steps necessary. We believe he can do that. He can take those steps. We're there to help. The Israelis can work with them. There are structures. There is the Tenet work plan that is exactly designed for that. These are not new initiatives. These are initiatives and structures that are in place. We are helping. We're there to help. It is what General Zinni is there for. So we think he has to take action against the individuals but also against the organizations responsible before they can commit further acts of terror. QUESTION: Well, some of the Palestinians today were saying that they had contacted the United States after the Israeli attacks began, to see what you could do to help. Can you tell us about anything -- any of those contacts, who contacted whom? MR. REEKER: I don't have any specifics on contacts. I believe it may have taken place in the region through our embassy or consulate. Certainly, in all of our messages to the Palestinians, we have emphasized the need to keep a focus on the steps that they must take, as I've indicated here. QUESTION: Where is Mr. Burns today? MR. REEKER: Mr. Burns is here in Washington. QUESTION: Nobody called him, perhaps? MR. REEKER: I don't know. I would have to check on all of his conversations. I just don't know that. Israel has taken their own decisions in terms of their response. But we have emphasized to the Palestinians just the message I have emphasized here to all of you and publicly and made clear again that we will maintain our effort with both parties to help them achieve a cease-fire. QUESTION: So when these contacts happened and the Palestinians called, at least one Palestinian official said that he spoke to a US official and said -- asked him to use whatever pressure the US could to get Israel to stop, you're saying that when that request was made to the US side, you responded by telling them they had to do more to stop violence? MR. REEKER: I am not saying, because I don't have any particular knowledge of those conversations. I am giving you a general view of what all of our messages to the Palestinians have been, as told to me. QUESTION: Back to chopping out the infrastructure, does the State Department have an opinion on the Israelis chopping out the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure? Would you counsel against it? Are you counseling against that? MR. REEKER: I don't think I quite understand your question. QUESTION: I am saying that there is a problem with terrorist infrastructure. Arafat, you've called on to take the steps necessary to take it out. And how I read Sharon's speech today is that he announced that he was going to take out that infrastructure. My question is that if Israel has a right to defend itself, does that count in the circle of activities that would be considering self-defense? MR. REEKER: Let me just refer you back to all of the things that I have said already. There is a structure in place for security talks that we have tried to help facilitate. General Zinni remains there, along with others on the ground, the Tenet work plan and the structure that it provides for the two sides to work together to end the violence and to maintain -- achieve and maintain a cease-fire. The Israelis, as we've said, we understand need to take their own decisions regarding self-defense. We always feel that they need to consider, both parties need to consider repercussions of their actions so that they are thinking about the next day and the day after that. We are there on the ground. We want to help both sides work on this. Everybody needs to take action together. By working on it together, we think they can achieve real progress. But first and foremost, we think Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority need to take the concrete steps. We have heard the statements, we have heard the promises. We need to see the sustained action necessary to bring the perpetrators of the acts of the weekend to justice, and to bring all of the violence down, to as I said, root out the infrastructure of the groups that support terrorists to that they can't perpetrate further acts of terror. QUESTION: Phil, can I just ask it one more time again, and then just sort of yes or no. Does the United States believe that Israeli efforts against the Palestinian terror network inside Palestinian territories counts as acting in its self-defense? MR. REEKER: That's a decision for the Israelis to make. They have to make their decisions; we call upon them to think about the repercussions of their decisions. And I think I have answered that as well as I -- QUESTION: (Inaudible.) MR. REEKER: Hi. Welcome. QUESTION: Just going back to the question of restraint. I understand that Israel has a right to defend itself, and that we -- you said we haven't changed our views in terms of all the things we have been saying. But it is significant that the US did not issue an appeal to Israel to restrain its response, and we all knew that there was going to be a response today. And -- MR. REEKER: I didn't. QUESTION: Well, okay. Well, you knew that there was going to be a response at some point. It was obvious that there was going to be a response at some point, not today; we don't know that. But why is it that, in the past, the US has issued an appeal to the Israelis after Palestinian attacks to restrain its response to avoid further escalation of violence? Why was it okay? MR. REEKER: I just don't think I have anything further to add to what I have already said here and repeated it numerous times, to what the President has said, what the Secretary has said, what the President's spokesman has said, and I'm sure numerous other people have said. QUESTION: This is about what they didn't say, though. MR. REEKER: Look, what happened over the weekend was abominable. QUESTION: Absolutely. MR. REEKER: There were horrendous, heinous, horrific acts of violence that killed innocent people, young people. The descriptions of what happened to those people, how they were killed, defy comprehension. And so we have expressed our sympathies on that, we have made very clear what we think Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority need to do, the sustained action they need to take. We understand that Prime Minister Sharon, that Israel is responsible for providing security for its citizens. We also say, again, that we think the Israelis and both sides need to consider the repercussions of their actions so that peace can be achieved. And that still needs to be the goal. They have got to look at what the future will hold, what tomorrow and the day after that will be. And they have the opportunity to work together, with our assistance, with the assistance of others in the international community, to get the violence down, to achieve a cease-fire, to maintain a cease-fire, and move into the process laid out before them, to which we have all agreed is the way to go. QUESTION: Have we ever in the past, has the US ever said that the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves, when there have been 800 Palestinian deaths, all also young people killed with US missiles from helicopter, gunships, you know, Israel has gotten from the US? We have never said that the Palestinians have a right to defend themselves, when they are in fact in those territories occupied. MR. REEKER: I think we have condemned death and killing and terrorism in all quarters, and what we need to do is see a process by which the death ends, which the violence ceases, which we get into the end to this cycle. And that is what we are calling on both sides to do, to work towards. That is why we have an envoy in the region. That is why we have said we are available to work with others to take the steps necessary to end that. QUESTION: (Inaudible)? MR. REEKER: Look, there's a process, Jonathan -- QUESTION: No, it's a reasonable question. MR. REEKER: There's a process, Jonathan, by which they can end this violence. There are suicide bombers that have gone in, committed terrorist acts of the most heinous nature. I think it does answer the question, Jonathan. And they can both take the efforts to end that type of terrorist action. QUESTION: (Inaudible.) MR. REEKER: Arafat is -- QUESTION: Either they do or they don't. I mean, which one is it? MR. REEKER: Jonathan, if they work together through the process, we can get the violence down so that we don't have to be talking about self-defense, so that we can be talking in a more positive tone about moving forward for peace. QUESTION: Why are we talking about self-defense for the Israelis then? MR. REEKER: Jonathan, over the weekend events occurred, and we understand the Israeli need to take action in self-defense. They will make those decisions. We think they need to make those decisions carefully. They need to think about the repercussions. We think that -- QUESTION: (Inaudible) -- the Israelis do. That's it? MR. REEKER: Well, I'll let you make your statements, Jonathan, and I'll make my statements. And you as an independent journalist, I will allow you to make your statements in your writings, not here. I don't think I have anything further to add to that. QUESTION: Essentially, you take no position on the Israeli strikes today in Gaza and Jenin and Bethlehem. I mean, you say -- MR. REEKER: I think I have been very clear on what our position is. And our bottom line position is we think both sides need to get back -- QUESTION: You are not saying it is a good thing, and you are not saying it's a bad thing. You're not condemning it. And you're not saying it's provocative. But at the same time, you're saying keep in mind -- MR. REEKER: I mean, I could review everything I haven't said -- QUESTION: -- the repercussions -- MR. REEKER: -- and I can say what I've said over again. But I think you would get bored with that. QUESTION: And what's to say we're not already. MR. REEKER: I'm sure you are. But I don't ask the questions. (Laughter.) QUESTION: The point is you are not taking a position on the Israeli response today? MR. REEKER: Our position is that responses should be thought through. The repercussions of those responses should be thought through. And that's I think all there is. QUESTION: For instance, in the past, when Israelis have made incursions into Gaza, into other places, you have come out and said, we think this is a bad thing. You're not doing that here, correct? MR. REEKER: I don't believe I have said that today. I don't -- QUESTION: Can we assume that everything you didn't say was not said intentionally? (Laughter.) MR. REEKER: Norm gets the prize for the day. We could spend all afternoon and I could keep talking. I bet I could outlast all of you. All right, if there is a new question, let's go ahead and see if there is something. QUESTION: These missiles or bombs or whatever that they lobbed seemed to be headed right at the Palestinian authority and Arafat's headquarters. Does that mean you believe Israel is defending itself and that the attacks came from Arafat himself and his authority? MR. REEKER: I don't know what they targeted. I saw the same pictures on television you did. I have no special information about that. QUESTION: All right. Another subject? MR. REEKER: Why don't we move to somebody else. QUESTION: Do you have any details on the American that was found to be fighting with the Taliban? Have you identified this man and anything else you can -- MR. REEKER: The individual rumored to be an American. QUESTION: He said on live television that he was American and -- MR. REEKER: That is pretty easy to do. One can do that. The State Department is working closely with the Defense Department to try to confirm the identity of the individual in question. As you can imagine, given the possibility that he is indeed a US citizen, we must presume a right of privacy and protect that right. Obviously, we would have no Privacy Act waiver. So until we are able to make further conclusions or get further information, I just don't have anything for you on the story. QUESTION: You don't know what he is, a naturalized US citizen or anything? MR. REEKER: I don't have any information. We are trying to work to confirm his identity and his citizenship. QUESTION: Can I follow up? His parents have -- his parents have said that -- have confirmed -- MR. REEKER: I am sure that is one of the factors and one of the pieces of information that is going into the analysis of his identity and his citizenship. QUESTION: Does an American citizen found to be -- if he is indeed American -- found to be fighting against the US behind enemy lines have a right of privacy, the right to a privacy waiver, or the Privacy Act? MR. REEKER: American citizens do have Privacy Act waiver, and at this point we don't have any reason to go around that. So we will need to wait until we get more facts and I will let you know all we can when we have something to announce. QUESTION: Do you know what -- if he is found to be an American, what he would be charged with and what the -- such a crime would be punishable with? Is that a crime of treason? MR. REEKER: I don't. You need to talk to the Justice Department about that. QUESTION: If he is a US citizen, is it true that he cannot be tried in the Pentagon military tribunal? MR. REEKER: You would need to ask the Pentagon or the Justice Department those questions. QUESTION: On this same subject, not specifically related to this individual, what does someone have to do to lose their citizenship? MR. REEKER: Someone suggested you were going to ask me that question. QUESTION: And what are the implications of that, if one does? MR. REEKER: I'm told that US citizens are not generally prohibited from serving in foreign militaries -- I can think of a number of instances where that occurs -- although doing so may have some adverse consequences for them. Without -- I leave that to you to fill in the blanks, Matt. Without any particular relevance to this case, because we don't know the facts or the situation there, under Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person could lose US citizenship by ""serving in the armed forces of a foreign state, if such forces are engaged in hostilities against the United States, but only if the person intended to relinquish US citizenship."" And so there may be some questions as to whether Taliban forces would meet the definition of ""armed forces of a foreign state"" in this provision of the law. I think it is something obviously that would have to be looked at by the Department of Justice, by numerous lawyers. The first step, clearly, is for us to continue working with the Department of Defense in verifying identification and citizenship of the individual in question. QUESTION: Has he been seen by a consular officer? MR. REEKER: Not that I am aware of. There are no consular access issues involved, since he is being detained by the US military, not a foreign government. QUESTION: What you were talking about before in terms of the immigration, does that -- does a congressional declaration of war figure into any of this? MR. REEKER: Matt, you're way off my territory, and we need to talk to the Justice Department about those questions of law. QUESTION: No, I'm asking about citizenship. MR. REEKER: Yes, and the State Department is not responsible for people's citizenship. So I think we would have to talk to Justice about that. I just don't have anything more. We looked into it at a cursory level, and the Immigration and Nationality Act -- QUESTION: No, let me make it straight. If the Taliban is determined to be a force of a state engaged in hostilities with the United States, someone who is an American citizen who is fighting for them could -- and only could -- be considered to have lost their citizenship? MR. REEKER: I'll let you look up Section 349(a)(3) -- QUESTION: I was trying to figure out what you just said, Phil. MR. REEKER: Yes. QUESTION: Only if they intend -- and the reason it's ""could"" is because they have to intend -- MR. REEKER: I'm just -- I'm not here to make a legal determination for you. I don't want to make a final legal judgment. I can't interpret the law fully. I'm pointing you to a part of the law. It's really a Justice Department matter. But the Immigration and Nationality Act is the binding law that would probably play in this still-hypothetical situation, until we have made the determinations a fact. And so that is one place you might look and see if lawyers or others would render a more firm opinion, and maybe the Justice Department would have something. QUESTION: Have you been -- has anyone from this building been in touch with the people who claim to be this guy's parents? MR. REEKER: I don't know. I would have to check. Or let me try to check here. I don't have any further information on it at all. But when we get some, we will be in touch, and you may want to talk to the Defense Department or the Justice Department as well. QUESTION: Have you heard anything from Mr. Dobbins in Bonn? And what is telling you? MR. REEKER: I think we have been in touch with Ambassador Dobbins fairly regularly. I think you are all aware that the Afghan representatives in Bonn met through the weekend, seeking agreement on a structure and composition for an interim authority for Afghanistan, and then on details of the process to establish a broad-based government through a loya jirga, the traditional process. Obviously it's a difficult process, but I think Ambassador Dobbins' general reports have indicated that the Afghans continue to make progress under this UN-sponsored process. There is general approval of a UN-drafted document on the structure of interim authority. And the last report I had was that they are finalizing detail and discussing the membership of the authority. But I just don't have any particular details on the whos and whats in terms of positions, or the exact role of the former King, Zahir Shah. That is still being worked out by the Afghan parties, and we certainly hope that they will keep working until they have a final agreement. QUESTION: Anything new on your active consideration of sending someone to the embassy in Kabul? MR. REEKER: Nothing new on that. I'm sure it is still being considered active. QUESTION: Right. Okay, and I've got one more very brief one. MR. REEKER: Sure. QUESTION: On Saturday, the Interior Minister of Peru came out and said that his government had arrested two Shining Path members, who were planning to attack or blow up the US Embassy in Lima today. Shortly after, or maybe shortly before his comments, the State Department put out an announcement about Peru, saying that there were indications that the Shining Path was trying to regroup, and that they may stage attacks against American interests this month, i.e. December. Is this what that statement was talking about? MR. REEKER: Obviously we have been in touch with the Peruvian authorities, and you are correct, we alerted American citizens in Peru, put it out there in a Public Announcement, to the possibility of heightened Shining Path activity. Embassy officials continue to review the security situation, working closely with Peruvian authorities, and as threats are discovered and they are considered credible, that is when we make these alerts. The Embassy and US facilities in Lima remain open to the public. We do understand that the Fulbright Commission, which is a private organization, but obviously linked to the United States, is closed today, and we certainly appreciate the efforts of the Government of Peru to monitor and disrupt potential terrorist attacks against US facilities, since our security officials work very closely with them. QUESTION: What is the Fulbright Commission? MR. REEKER: The Fulbright Commission would be the office that oversees the Fulbright Exchange Program. QUESTION: And is that in the embassy? MR. REEKER: No, I believe it is in a separate location. QUESTION: Why is it closed? QUESTION: In Lima, though? MR. REEKER: In Lima, yes. QUESTION: Why is it closed? Is there any specific threat? MR. REEKER: I don't have any more information on that, other than that they chose to close today. I don't have any further information on it. It's an independent organization. But to make clear that the embassy, however, is open. Okay, let's get to some of these folks here. Yes, sir. QUESTION: Now that we're in Latin America, let me ask you about Venezuela. I've been trying to get somebody to say something over here. But if there is a serious political explosion down there within the next week and you don't say anything about it or appear to know anything about it, I would think you would be somewhat embarrassed. Do you know about the situation? MR. REEKER: I'm never embarrassed when I stand up here and take your questions. I think you are referring to the situation where the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce has called for a general strike on December 10th. Am I correct in that reference? QUESTION: A week from today, right. MR. REEKER: Protesting the recent enactment by President Chavez of several laws. And we have said that the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers -- they have said that they will support that strike. It is a domestic, internal domestic matter. It is certainly not appropriate for the US to comment at this time. We are looking, of course, through our consular information program at any need for public announcements in case the situation warrants people taking a look at their travel plans or their situation there. So we will let you know if we have any updates to make in terms of that. QUESTION: If the supply of oil from down there should be cut off, what are you prepared to do about it? MR. REEKER: I think you are speaking in hypotheticals. I think it is not something that is part of the State Department's purview. Our embassy will continue to monitor developments in Venezuela closely, as we always do. We are not going to characterize a situation there or anywhere else based on possible future events. There is, I think, a larger democratic dialogue going on in Venezuela and this proposed general strike is part of that. So we will continue to watch events there and be happy to take your questions as things evolve. QUESTION: Would the US be willing to apply the Carta Democratica of the OEA? MR. REEKER: It's purely speculative at this point. QUESTION: Would the US support making a requirement for Arafat to take additional substantive action toward ending terrorist groups as being part of a new peace agreement in the Middle East? Being an actual -- MR. REEKER: I just don't think I have anything to add that far down the road. We need to get a cease-fire, we need to end the violence. We have a structure, the Mitchell Committee recommendations, which provide for the parties to move forward in an environment free of violence and move towards a peace agreement. Obviously, to have peace, you have to end violence and so that is what we are looking for, and I have already run through what we are calling on Chairman Arafat and his authority to undertake. QUESTION: There is an explosive article in Esquire coming out -- MR. REEKER: Coming out? Not out yet? QUESTION: It is already out. And it is involving Sudan and US policy in Sudan. QUESTION: Vanity Fair. QUESTION: Vanity Fair. Sorry. MR. REEKER: Well, then, let's move on -- QUESTION: No, no, no, no, no, let me just ask this question. In this article, one of the things the author claims is that the US supported with a lot of aid and in some cases sort of hints at military support the southern Christian rebels. Do you have any comment on that? MR. REEKER: I don't. I haven't seen the article. It hasn't actually come out yet. When I get my copy, I'll try to read it. QUESTION: It has. Susan Rice -- MR. REEKER: I couldn't rush out to the newsstand to get it, and my subscription may have lapsed. I'm sorry, Eli, I just don't have anything for that. QUESTION: Assuming that the answer to my question is going to be ""yes,"" and the question is, are the Saudis still cooperating with the US, can you tell us how Assistant Secretary Burns' visit to Riyadh went? I assume it went swimmingly well, since the Saudis are doing everything they can to help you out. MR. REEKER: Thank you, Matt. What Matt said. QUESTION: It went swimmingly well? MR. REEKER: Those of you that will recall, Assistant Secretary Burns was traveling in the region. In the course of his recent trip, he stopped in Riyadh, where he discussed a range of bilateral and regional issues with Saudi Arabian officials, including terrorist financing. He had solid discussions, in which we reaffirmed our mutual commitment to targeting the sources of international terrorism funding. As you know, we have had a constructive dialogue with Saudi Arabia on many issues, including this subject. The Secretary indicated way back on November 7th that Saudi Arabia has been prominent among the countries acting against the accounts of terrorist organizations, and like so many other countries taking action in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1333. So we understand that the Saudi Central Bank has issued instructions to banks in Saudi Arabia to look for and freeze accounts listed by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee, and we remain very pleased with the cooperation and work we have had together with the Saudis on this matter. QUESTION: Three related questions. Has there been any -- MR. REEKER: Three related questions? Can I get more water? QUESTION: Has there been any support from moderate governments -- Matt did mention Saudi Arabia -- religious factions that seem not to be entering into this because they're not states, and NGOs? And, secondly, is there some support that you are getting from the media, meaning not just us, but worldwide to end this good-boy/bad-boy type of reporting so that the parties, as you say, can somewhat meet under constructive -- to put together a constructive framework to enter, as you say, into the Mitchell plan without the media spotlight, not being undermined by what, say, one media group or another? MR. REEKER: Well, we always encourage the media not to undermine efforts toward peace. (Laughter.) That is certainly something we stand for. Joel, I think the topics you raise are certainly interesting, and probably more for a different forum where we may -- one of the think tanks around town or perhaps something we could organize here would be interesting to talk about that. Certainly in answer to your first question, we support numerous moderate or otherwise countries that we work with at a variety of levels, bilaterally and multilaterally in the region and elsewhere. Our goals in the campaign against terrorism are clear, and so I think that is something we will continue to work on. There was another one over here. I don't want to miss anybody. QUESTION: I didn't identify myself before. Lavine Salem with Islam Online. I just had one more question about Arafat's role. And I was wondering how the US could call on him to take substantive actions when all of his apparatus of doing so -- considering his headquarters is blown up, their police stations, et cetera -- how do you propose that he take those actions when his very resources are destroyed? MR. REEKER: We believe he can take those actions. He has said he will take action. He said it in his own statements. And so we want to hold him to those statements, and we think he can take action. QUESTION: More so than the arrests that he has made, which he has gotten a lot of grief for from Palestinians? MR. REEKER: Well, he shouldn't get grief for it, because making those type of arrests of those that carry out criminal acts like those committed over the weekend is what he needs to do, it is what he has agreed to do, and he needs to do more, and not just arresting perpetrators, but taking action to ensure that the organizations responsible can't commit further acts of terror, because that is the way we will move forward by ending this type of violence and moving forward in an atmosphere of calm into a process that could lead to peace. QUESTION: Just one last thing. As far as Israel's response, do you think that there now will be a Palestinian response, then another Israeli response? Because that seems to be what is happening. So unless there is a call for restraint on both sides, I think the debilitating obstacles -- MR. REEKER: Yes, I don't have anything further to add. We have been through this. We have been quite clear about what we want to see happen. We have people in the region, including General Zinni, the President's envoy, who is in close touch with officials here, with our embassy and consulate there in the region and in touch with officials from both Palestinian Authority and from the Israeli Government to try to see whatever we can do to help the process move along, to bring an end to the violence, to get a cease-fire that can be sustained so that we can move into a more positive direction than what we have seen in the last few days. QUESTION: Thank you."
USA_Doc5_Speech_Dom,"The vicious attacks that took place on September 11 made it clear that the United States must use every tool at its disposal to combat terrorism. Today I am taking another important step in our campaign to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. I am designating two groups, Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LET) and Jaish e-Mohammed (JEM), as Foreign Terrorist Organizations under U.S. law. These groups, which claim to be supporting the people of Kashmir, have conducted numerous terrorist attacks in India and Pakistan. As the recent horrific attacks against the Indian parliament and the Srinigar State Legislative Assembly so clearly show, the Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish e-Mohammed, and their ilk seek to assault democracy, undermine peace and stability in South Asia, and destroy relations between India and Pakistan. By designating these groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and publishing that decision today in the Federal Register, we implement the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. This Act makes it illegal for persons in the United States or subject to U.S. jurisdiction to provide material support to these terrorist groups; it requires U.S. financial institutions to block assets held by them; and it enables us to deny visas to representatives of these groups. I made this decision in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury after an exhaustive review of these groups' violent activities. The United States looks forward to working with the governments of both India and Pakistan to shut these groups down."
USA_Doc6_Speech_Dom,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. Please be seated. Thank you for that warm welcome. I'm glad to be back here at the Citadel. (Applause.) I have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place where I took up this subject two years ago when I was candidate for President. In September 1999, I said here at the Citadel that America was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by the threat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military transformation. That threat has now revealed itself, and that challenge is now the military and moral necessity of our time. (Applause.) So, today, I will set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror. I want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality. I want to thank the Citadel Board of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty. I understand the Governor is here. And I know my friends, the Lt. Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was great to have seen them at the airport. I thank my friend, Adjutant General Stan Spears for being here. I'm grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina congressional delegation flew down on Air Force One. I only wish that the senior Senator was on the airplane so I could have wished him a happy 99th birthday. (Applause.) But most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being in the presence of some of America's finest, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets of Citadel. (Applause.) Four days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. December 7th, 1941 was a decisive day that changed our nation forever. In a single moment, America's ""splendid isolation"" was ended. And the four years that followed transformed the American way of war. The age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft carriers. The tank, once used only to protect infantry, now served to cut through enemy lines. At Guadalcanal, and Normandy, and Iwo Jima, amphibious warfare proved its worth. And by war's end, no one would ever again doubt the value of strategic air power. Even more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond a war. They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed a great alliance for freedom in NATO, and expressed the hope of collective security in the United Nations. America took the lead, becoming freedom's defender and assuming responsibilities that only we could bear. September 11th, 2001 -- three months and a long time ago -- set another dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation. An illusion of immunity was shattered. A faraway evil became a present danger. And a great cause became clear: We will fight terror and those who sponsor it, to save our children from a future of fear. (Applause.) To win this war, we have to think differently. The enemy who appeared on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses. So America is required once again to change the way our military thinks and fights. And starting on October 7th, the enemy in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that cannot, and will not, be evaded. (Applause.) When I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that they would be up to the task. And they have proven me right. The Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominate a country and intimidate the world. Today, from their caves, it's all looking a little different. (Applause.) And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice of the United States of America. (Applause.) We are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war on terror. We have a chance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter in human history. All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations. Russia and America are building a new cooperative relationship. India and the United States are increasingly aligned across a range of issues, even as we work closely with Pakistan. Germany and Japan are assuming new military roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies. The vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideological divide. We're making common cause with every nation that chooses lawful change over chaotic violence -- every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life. Staring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw regimes. They are a movement defined by their hatreds. They hate progress, and freedom, and choice, and culture, and music, and laughter, and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims who reject their distorted doctrines. They love only one thing -- they love power. And when they have it, they use it without mercy. The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions. Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world. The great threat to civilization is that a few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on a scale equal to their hatred. We know they have this mad intent, and we're determined to stop them. Our lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a single commitment: The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and never allowed to gain or use the weapons of mass destruction. (Applause.) America and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our disposal. We will discover and destroy sleeper cells. We will track terrorist movements, trace their communications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece. Above all, we're acting to end the state sponsorship of terror. Rogue states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists. Every nation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, train, or equip the agents of terror. Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes. They have been warned, they are being watched, and they will be held to account. (Applause.) Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future. And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America. The first priority is to speed the transformation of our military. When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation was over. Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly to police and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict. They were wrong. While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not. (Applause.) We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them. This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle. Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach. These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict. The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor. And they have made this nation proud. Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly. Our intelligence professionals and special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the local culture. And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21st century. (Applause.) This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used before. The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tank symposiums. The Predator is a good example. This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy. Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways. Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles. We're entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air, and at sea. Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise. In the Gulf War, these weapons were the exception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we have used. We're striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties. More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets. When all of our military can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space -- warfare will be truly revolutionized. The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and before September the 11th. Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms. The same recommendation was made in the strategic review that Secretary Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully endorse. What's different today is our sense of urgency -- the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It's like overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour. Yet we have no other choice. Our military has a new and essential mission. For states that support terror, it's not enough that the consequences be costly -- they must be devastating. (Applause.) The more credible this reality, the more likely that regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that America and our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them. To build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract America's best people, with good pay and good living conditions. Our military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and experimentation. Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department. And every service and every constituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects. Our war on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon systems. Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test: It must help us build the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future. (Applause.) Our country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting those who fight for it. We will give our men and women in uniform every resource, every weapon, every tool they need to win the long battle that lies ahead. America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. I wish I could report to the American people that this threat does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombs and box cutters -- but I cannot. One former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved in an effort 10 years ago to obtain nuclear materials. And the leader of al Qaeda calls that effort ""a religious duty."" Abandoned al Qaeda houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of mass destruction. And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the U.S. mail, and used sarin gas in a Tokyo subway. And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges. Their hope is to blackmail the United States into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends and allies and security commitments around the world. Our enemies are bound for disappointment. America will never be blackmailed, and we will never forsake our commitment to liberty. (Applause.) To meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor and my Homeland Security Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on proliferation. Working with other countries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls. Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people. A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites. Our two countries will expand efforts to provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked in Soviet weapons facilities. The United States will also work with Russia to build a facility to destroy tons of nerve agent. I'll request an over-all increase in funding to support this vital mission. Even as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every possibility. At home, we must be better prepared to detect, protect against, and respond to the potential use of weapons of mass destruction. Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight and win against enemies who would use such weapons against us. Biodefense has become a major initiative of ours. This year we've already requested nearly $3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, more than doubling the level of funding prior to September the 11th. The attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build limited and effective defenses against a missile attack. (Applause.) Our enemies seek every chance and every means to do harm to our country, our forces, and our friends. And we will not permit it. Suppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America or important allies with a ballistic missile. Our coalition would have become fragile, the stakes in our war much, much higher. We must protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including the terror that could arrive on a missile. Last week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense technology. For the good of peace, we're moving forward with an active program to determine what works and what does not work. In order to do so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a treaty that was written in a different era, for a different enemy. (Applause.) America and our allies must not be bound to the past. We must be able to build the defenses we need against the enemies of the 21st century. Our third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to strengthen the advantage that good intelligence gives our country. Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligence briefing of that morning. To reach decisions, a President needs more than data and information. A President needs real and current knowledge and analysis of the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our enemies. The last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good intelligence officers, people on the ground. These are the people who find the targets, follow our enemies, and help us disrupt their evil plans. The United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence. (Applause.) And we will apply the best new technology to gather intelligence on the new threats. Sophisticated systems like Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities. Our technological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on them. Our intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work more closely together, and share timely information with our state and local authorities. The more we know, the more terrorist plans we can prevent and disrupt, and the better we'll be able to protect the American people. And in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best people -- the best collectors, the best analysts, the best linguists. We will give them the training they need and the compensation they deserve. There have been times here in America when our intelligence services were held in suspicion, and even contempt. Now, when we face this new war, we know how much we need them. And for their dedication and for their service, America is grateful. (Applause.) We're also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel. Your uniforms symbolize a tradition of honor and sacrifice, renewed in your own lives. Many of you will enter our military -- taking your place in the war against terror. That struggle may continue for many years, and it may bring great costs. But you will have chosen a great calling at a crucial hour for our nation. The course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many nations. If America wavers, the world will lose heart. If America leads, the world will show its courage. America will never waver. America will lead the world to peace. (Applause.) Our cause is necessary. Our cause is just. And no matter how long it takes, we will defeat the enemies of freedom. (Applause.) In all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring credit to America, to the military, and to this great institution. In the words of your school song, you will go where you've always gone -- ""in the paths our fathers showed us. Peace and Honor, God and Country -- we will fight for thee."" God bless. (Applause.)"
USA_Doc7_Interv_For,"Secretary Powell: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The world has changed dramatically since September 11 and NATO has responded dramatically. Immediately after the September 11 attacks NATO was the first to offer its support, invoking Article V for the first time in its history. On a personal note, I will never forget the afternoon of the 12th of September, the day after the attack, talking to the Secretary General, Lord Robertson, and getting this expression of solidarity on the part of NATO. It has meant a great deal to us in the United States to have this immediate response on the part of this great alliance we have proudly served within over the last many, many years. Fifty-two years. And to see that everybody recognized that this attack was so severe that it warranted Article V. This unflinching decision, and the critical assistance this alliance has provided, has sent a clear message to our enemies about the depth of our common purpose.These attacks have demonstrated just how indispensable the NATO alliance with its collective defense commitment remains to our security, fifty years after the creation of NATO. Our resolve is shown by the NATO AWACS flying over the skies of North America and by NATO naval forces deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Allied nations sent forces to the field to fight side by side alongside our forces, and more are standing by should they be needed. A decade ago, allies decided to address the threats of the 21st century, including terrorism. September 11 added new urgency to this process. Today, building on our obligations under Article III of the North Atlantic Treaty, we agreed to move rapidly to defend against terrorism and other emerging threats. More broadly, NATO continues to enhance stability and security throughout the Euro-Atlantic area. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has sought to build closer ties with Russia as a means of increasing that security. Today, the Alliance discussed ways to enhance our partnership with Russia, to build a more open, cooperative and confident relationship that reflects the values and interests we share with Russia. Our goal is to create a NATO-Russia Council to pursue opportunities for joint action at 20 when our views converge. We have asked our ambassadors in Brussels to work out details in the coming months. This is an opportunity for NATO and Russia to improve qualitatively the way we work together.Let me stress, however, that as we strengthen ties with Russia, it is not becoming a NATO member. NATO, at 19, will maintain its prerogative to act independently on any issue. So we are not limiting NATO by NATO ""at 20"" but, in fact, we're leveraging NATO with the inclusion of Russia in NATO at 20. NATO has a lot of other important issues on its plate as it prepares for next year's summit in Prague. We have made great strides since the end of the Cold War in overcoming divisions of the past and reaching out to former adversaries. But we have yet to complete our vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.We remain firmly committed to continuing the enlargement process at the Prague summit in November of 2002. NATO will continue to anchor the continent's new democracies firmly in the transatlantic community and to ensure the success of democratic institutions and the democratic transition process. We also discussed ways to intensify our outreach to all of NATO's partners, many of whom are playing vital roles in the campaign against terrorism. We particularly welcome NATO's efforts to strengthen partnerships with the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus region. NATO's success in the Balkans demonstrates our ability to meet whatever challenges confront us. Alliance solidarity remains the cornerstone of our policy there. As President Bush has said clearly, ""We came in together. And we will leave together."" This commitment has not changed even as we work together to hasten the day when the region can look forward to a secure future in partnership with NATO and its Partnership for Peace, and without a NATO-led force present.As allies prepare the way to Prague next November, NATO and the transatlantic community continue to form the indispensable foundation for the peace and prosperity of all our nations and those who are friends of NATO as well. Since NATO's creation over fifty years ago, we have met our challenges together. And together we will conquer today's challenges as well. Thank you very much. Now I'm prepared for your questions. Question: Mr. Secretary, there has been a report in the last hour, so I'm not sure you're aware of it, that Mullah Omar has talked about relinquishing control of Kandahar Friday. Are you aware of it, and do you have a comment? Secretary Powell: I am aware of the report. I can't confirm it. I think it reflects the fact that Kandahar is under a great deal of pressure, and the Taliban control in that part of the country is starting to fragment and come apart. And I think it is just a matter of time. And if this report turns out to be accurate, I think it will be a very positive move, as we get rid of the Taliban regime and prepare the country for the return of legitimate government in the form of the interim administration, which was created earlier this week in Bonn. Question: How do you think how the newly established friendship between Russia and NATO will reflect on the relationship between NATO and the US, with the Caucasian states, in particular with Georgia? Secretary Powell: I think it will enhance our ability to deal with difficult issues such as Georgia. We will be meeting NATO at 20, when we get it all established. The 20 will be meeting on a very regular basis here in Brussels. I would expect they could meet several times a week. There is an opportunity for greater consultation and coordination, a greater opportunity for us to present our current concerns to Russia, and for Russia to respond to those concerns and to give us their perspective.So I think this will make it easier for us to deal with these sorts of issues as they come along that affect the entire Euro-Atlantic community. And so I think it will enhance our ability to deal with these kinds of issues. Question: Could you please comment on another aspect of the situation in Afghanistan, with General Dostum appearing to oppose the government deal? And also, on the Middle East, you have been asking President Arafat to make 100 percent effort; he seems to have done just that, and he has run into some difficulties. What would you like to say to him now? Secretary Powell: With respect to General Dostum, I don't have any details on the position you just described. I am confident, however, that the interim administration that has been selected is representative of the Afghan people and all the various parts of Afghan society. It will enjoy the support of the international community. It will be able to set up a government that then can expand into a broader government.And so I hope that upon reflection all of the leaders in Afghanistan, the military leaders and other leaders, will welcome the arrival of the interim administration on the 22nd of December. And notwithstanding what differences may exist between individuals and the administration, I hope they will put those differences behind them in order to give the Afghan people a new lease on life with this new government. With respect to the Middle East, our message has been clear and consistent for the last several days, that Chairman Arafat has to make 100 percent effort. I have noticed in the last 24 hours that there have been more arrests, there have been other activities on his part that are promising. But I think more is required. I recognize that he is having some difficulties with those organizations which resist his authority. The very fact that they are resisting his authority makes it that much more important for him to apply that authority.I have been in contact with General Zinni, our envoy in the region, and my diplomats in the region, and we are still doing everything we can to get the situation under control and to see if we can start conversations again with security officials on both sides, and that is not a lost cause. There has been some minor progress in the last 24 hours, as General Zinni has talked to both sides, and start to put in place a way in which the two sides can start talking to each other, security officials to security officials, to bring some order out of this chaos and this very, very dangerous situation. Question: Mr. Secretary, a question on the campaign against terrorism. Prior to the offensive against the al-Qaida and the Taliban, the United States made a great effort to lay before its allies the evidence that it had for the links between this organization and the attacks in the United States. If and when you decide to move to another stage of the campaign, possibly targeting other countries, will you be, as a preliminary, setting out your evidence in that sort of detail prior to taking any military action against other countries? Secretary Powell: The United States will not act against another country or another group without a basis for taking such action. Taking military action is a serious matter, and we don't do it unadvisedly or without having solid evidence. It will depend on the specific country involved or the specific group involved as to what we are able to put in the public domain with respect to evidence. With respect to al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden and the Taliban, we were able to put some information out rather quickly, and then our British colleagues were able to put out another body of information, and then we were able to follow up. And there were those then who said, do you have all the evidence that you need? And we were quite sure we did, and put out as much as we reasonably could at that time, considering security concerns. But I don't think there is anybody who doubts now that al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden were responsible for what happened on the 11th of September. And we will act with the same care and consideration as we move forward to Phase 3 and the subsequent phases of our campaign against terrorism. Question: Secretary Powell, before you arrived here in Brussels, you said that you were going to be talking with US allies about various offers to contribute to this international peacekeeping force, this coalition of the willing. You said you were going to try to answer questions about the mandate, the size, who would lead it. Have you come any closer to that, in putting this force together, and is it necessary for this force to be in place before December 22nd, when the interim administration moves to Kabul? Secretary Powell: I have had some bilateral discussions with my colleagues here, and I expect to have more in the course of the afternoon, just to share with them my thinking on it, the United States thinking on it, and to get their views. The interim administration that was created in Bonn has asked for an international force to come in, and we are now talking to our friends, talking to the United Nations about what the mandate of this force should be, what mission should it be ready to perform. They asked for it initially to be in Kabul. Where will we put it in Kabul? And what has impressed me so greatly are the number of countries who have stepped forward and said they are willing to contribute troops to such a force. There will be no shortage of troops. Getting the right mix and determining the leadership of this force has yet to be sorted out. For the foreseeable future, General Tommy Franks, our commander, the CENTCOM commander, will command all of the coalition forces that are in the theater, because he still has a mission of going after al-Qaida, the Taliban and Usama bin Laden.I would expect, however, that as the international force comes into the theater, and as General Franks winds down his part of the mission, we would pass off control to the leader of this coalition of the willing. The point with respect to whether we get it in there before the 22nd or not, we haven't really discussed this, whether that is an essential matter or not. The 22nd isn't that far away and you just don't beam people in. There is quite a process required to identify units, get them ready to go and then actually move them into the theater.Let me just touch on the fact that there are so many countries, not only in NATO and elsewhere, that are willing to contribute. There has been some speculation that NATO was kept on the sidelines. Quite the contrary, it was just a source of great encouragement to me to see how so many of our NATO colleagues came forward immediately and said, we'll put 2, 000 people on alert, we'll put 6, 000 people on alert, we'll give you more AWACS, we'll give you C-130s, we'll give you special operating forces. We're ready, tell us what you need. There are 200 liaison officers at our headquarters in Tampa, Florida, all anxious to be a part of it. I understand that.But when you run a campaign plan, you have to feed units into the campaign as you need them, and there will be future needs as we get into this international peacekeeping force. So the suggestion that NATO has been kept on the sidelines is not an accurate one. NATO was right there at the very beginning with the offer of its capabilities.And then we had the option, the pleasant option, of choosing from that menu that was provided and all that capability that was made available to us by NATO. That shows the relevance of NATO. And as we get further into this international peacekeeping force, I am quite sure we will be going back to our NATO allies, most likely on a bilateral basis or within the UN framework, to ask them to bring those capabilities, bring those units forward in order to keep Afghanistan moving in the right direction. Far from being on the sidelines, NATO has been front and center since day one. Mr. Brodeur: I think we only have time for two more. Question: Secretary Powell, just to follow up on this, do you see a collective NATO role in this international force in Afghanistan? Secretary Powell: I am sure it will be discussed collectively within NATO councils. But as you know, Article V doesn't say the whole alliance has to respond collectively. Each individual member of the alliance decides how it will contribute to that Article V invocation requirement or commitment. And so I am quite sure we will be discussing with Lord Robertson and his colleagues what the needs are. But then I think the actual contributions and the deals that will be cut will be between the leader of the coalition of the willing and the individual countries who are offering capabilities, because they will not only be NATO offers, they will be offers from many other nations around the world who have made such offers, and there will have to be a UN role in it as well.So it will be a little complicated, but we have dealt with complicated situations like this before, and they all tend to work out notwithstanding what looks like bureaucratic impasses at the front end. Question: Mr. Secretary, in previous NATO and NAC meetings, some of the issues of contention were very much related to the US and to Russia, like the ABM Treaty, like concern over US national missile defense. And now we are told at this meeting they didn't come up, if at all, or at least weren't heated arguments. Do you think that these matters are just being obscured for the time being by the dominance and the urgency of the September 11th issues? Do you think they will come up again as contentions inside NATO and the NAC? And now with the addition of Russia, does that make these bilateral issues NATO-centric now as well? Secretary Powell: You sound wistful for a contentious past there, Teri. (Laughter.) No, we had a very, very straight, clean-cut meeting, where we knew what we were about. Terrorism was in pride of place for this meeting. And since we have been working together on this since the afternoon of the 11th of September, we pretty much knew what we had to do, and I'm very pleased with the statements that are being made.With respect to NATO-Russia at 20, we have had good, intense conversations for the past several weeks, and I am pleased at how quickly we came to a unified position within the alliance, and we look forward to discussing it with Foreign Minister Ivanov tomorrow.There are still issues out with respect to missile defense, and as you discussed with Lord Robertson a few moments ago, how we actually decide which of the one to nine nations will be allowed into, invited to join, the alliance in Prague in November of the next year. So there are lots of issues out there, and there are issues that we don't even know about yet that will come up. That's what makes this alliance so vibrant, that nobody would have thought three months ago that we would be spending the fall season talking about terrorism, but here we are. And because we can't see into the future clearly, because we are looking into a glass dimly and darkly, we don't know what is going to come along. That is why it is important to have alliances such as NATO that are vibrant, that change with the times, that can adapt to new challenges and threats that come along.But the consistency that exists within an alliance such as this is that we are likeminded nations with a firm belief in democracy and the free enterprise system, and believe that is a system that can benefit all of the nations in the Euro-Atlantic region. And that because we are able to debate contentious issues and arrive at consensus conclusions that reflect the will of the free peoples of NATO and allow us to move forward.Thank you."
USA_Doc8_Speech_Dom,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Ed, thanks. Thanks for the kind introduction. I'm looking forward to working with you for the next 14 months -- but you better put on your running shoes, because my spirits are high, my energy level is good and I'm sprinting to the finish line. (Applause.) I congratulate you on your 30th anniversary as President -- (laughter.) No such thing as term limits here. (Laughter.) And rightly so, because Ed is a person who has taken the conservative movement from one that used to meet in a phone booth here in Washington -- (laughter) -- to a robust group of folks who are shaping policy in Washington, D.C. As a matter of fact, you've got a little bigger phone booth these days than you did 30 years ago. (Laughter.) I appreciate all you've done and I really want to thank Heritage. One of the interesting things about the Heritage legacy is that the folks here have been tireless advocates, tireless champions of liberty, and free enterprise, and democracy and religious freedom. These are values that came under attack on September the 11th, 2001. Our nation was attacked by a brutal enemy that despises freedom, that rejects tolerance, that kills the innocent in the pursuit of a dark vision. These folks believe that it's okay to subjugate women and indoctrinate children and murder those who oppose their harsh rule. They have stated clearly they want to impose this ideology on millions. They're at war with America because they hate what they stand for -- and they understand we stand in their way. And so today I've come to talk to you about the war on terror, my firm commitment that we'll do everything in our power to protect the American people, and my call on the United States Congress to give us the tools necessary so we can do the job the American people expect. I, too, want to thank the members of the Heritage Foundation Board of Trustees who have joined us. Thank you for supporting this important organization. I can't tell you how important it is to have good centers of thought in Washington, D.C. -- people who are willing to look at today's problems and come up with innovative solution based upon sound principle to solve those problems. And that's how I view Heritage. I thank all the members and guests who've joined us today, as well. It's a pleasure to be with you. It's been now more than six years since the enemy attacked us on September the 11th, and we are blessed that there has not been another attack on our soil. With the passage of time, the memories of the 9/11 attacks have grown more distant. And for some, there's a temptation to think that the threats to our country have grown distant as well. They have not. The terrorists who struck America that September morning intend to strike us again. We know this, because the enemy has told us so. Just last year, Osama bin Laden warned the American people, ""Operations are under preparation, and you will see them on your own ground once they are finished."" Seven months later, British authorities broke up the most ambitious known al Qaeda plot since the 9/11 attacks -- a plot to blow up passenger airplanes flying over the Atlantic toward the United States. Our intelligence community believes that this plot was just two or three weeks away from execution. If it had been carried out, it could have rivaled 9/11 in death and destruction. The lesson of this experience is clear. We must take the words of the enemy seriously. The terrorists have stated their objectives. They intend to build a totalitarian Islamic empire -- encompassing all current and former Muslim lands, stretching from Europe to North Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In pursuit of their imperial aims, these extremists say there can be no compromise or dialog with those they call infidels -- a category that includes America, the world's free nation [sic], Jews, and all Muslims who reject their extreme vision of Islam. They reject the possibility of peaceful coexistence with the free world. Again, hear the words of Osama bin Laden last year: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us."" History teaches that underestimating the words of evil, ambitious men is a terrible mistake. In the early 1900s, the world ignored the words of Lenin, as he laid out his plans to launch a Communist revolution in Russia -- and the world paid a terrible price. The Soviet Empire he established killed tens of millions, and brought the world to the brink of thermonuclear war. In the 1920s, the world ignored the words of Hitler, as he explained his intention to build an Aryan super-state in Germany, take revenge on Europe, and eradicate the Jews -- and the world paid a terrible price. His Nazi regime killed millions in the gas chambers, and set the world aflame in war, before it was finally defeated at a terrible cost in lives and treasure. Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them. And the question is: Will we listen? America and our coalition partners are listening. We have made our choice. We take the words of the enemy seriously. Over the past six years, we have captured or killed hundreds of terrorists. We have disrupted their finances. We have prevented new attacks before they could be carried out. We removed regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq that had supported terrorists and threatened our citizens, and in so doing, liberated 50 million people from the clutches of tyranny. (Applause.) With our allies, we're keeping the pressure on the enemy. We're keeping him on the move. We're fighting them everywhere they make their stand -- from the mountains of Afghanistan, to the deserts of Iraq, to the islands of Southeast Asia and the Horn of Africa. On every battlefront, we're on the offense. We're keeping constant pressure. And in this war on terror we will not rest, or retreat, or withdraw from the fight until this threat to civilization has been removed. (Applause.) I fully understand that after six years, the sense of imminent danger has passed for some -- and it can be natural for people to forget the lessons of 9/11 as they go about their daily lives. I just want to assure you that I'll never forget the lessons of September the 11th, and nor will the people with whom I work. I know that when I discuss the war on terror, some here in Washington, D.C. dismiss it as political rhetoric -- an attempt to scare people into votes. Given the nature of the enemy and the words of its leaders, politicians who deny that we are at war are either being disingenuous or naive. Either way, it is dangerous for our country. We are at war -- and we cannot win this war by wishing it away or pretending it does not exist. Unfortunately, on too many issues, some in Congress are behaving as if America is not at war. For example, in a time of war, it is vital for the President to have a full national security team in place -- and a key member of that team is the Attorney General. The job of the Attorney General is essential to the security of America. The Attorney General is the highest ranking official responsible for our law enforcement community's efforts to detect and prevent terrorist attacks here at home. I've selected an outstanding nominee to fill this vital role: Judge Michael Mukasey. Judge Mukasey has a long record of accomplishments in matter of law and national security. He has been praised by Republicans and Democrats alike as a man of honesty, intellect, fairness and independence. Judge Mukasey provided nearly six hours of testimony. He patiently answered more than 200 questions at the hearing. He has responded to nearly 500 written questions less than a week after his hearing. Yet the Senate Judiciary Committee has been holding up his nomination. As a price of his confirmation, some on that committee want Judge Mukasey to take a legal position on specific techniques allegedly used to interrogate captured terrorists. As Judge Mukasey explained in a letter to committee members, he cannot do so for several reasons: First, he does not know whether certain methods of questioning are in fact used, because the program is classified -- and therefore he is in no position to provide an informed opinion. He has not been read into the program, and won't until he is confirmed and sword in -- won't be until he is confirmed and sworn in as the Attorney General. Second, he does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy. Finally, he does not want any statement of his to give the terrorists a window into which techniques we may use, and which ones we may not use. That could help them train their operatives to resist questioning, and withhold vital information we need to stop attacks and save lives. In the war on terror, intelligence is one of the most crucial tools for our defense. If a captured terrorist has information about a plot against our homeland, we need to know what he knows. And so that's why I put in place in place, under the CIA, a program to question key terrorist operatives and its leaders. Last year, Congress passed a law that allows the CIA to continue this vital program. The procedures used in this program are safe. They are lawful. And they are necessary. (Applause.) Senior leaders in the House and Senate, from both political parties, have been briefed on the details of this program. It's wrong for congressional leaders to make Judge Mukasey's confirmation dependent on his willingness to go on the record about the details of a classified program he has not been briefed on. If the Senate Judiciary Committee were to block Judge Mukasey on these grounds, they would set a new standard for confirmation that could not be met by any responsible nominee for Attorney General. And that would guarantee that America would have no Attorney General during this time of war. By any measure, Judge Mukasey is eminently qualified to be the next Attorney General. And now, after allowing his nomination to languish for 41 days, the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for next Tuesday. Senate leaders must move this nomination out of committee, bring it to the Senate floor and confirm this good man. (Applause.) Congress has also failed to act on intelligence legislation that is vital to protect the American people in this war on terror. Stopping new attacks on our country requires us to make sure we understand the intentions of the enemy. We've got to know what they're thinking and what they're planning. And that means we got to have effective measures to monitor their communications. This summer, Congress passed the Protect America Act, which strengthened our ability to collect foreign intelligence on terrorists overseas and this good law closed a dangerous gap in our intelligence. Unfortunately, they made this law effective for only six months. The problem is that al Qaeda doesn't operate on a six-month timetable. (Laughter.) And if Congress doesn't act soon, the law will expire -- and the gap in our intelligence will reopen, and the United States of America will be at risk. We must keep the intelligence gap firmly closed. If terrorists are communicating with each other and are plotting new attacks, we need to know what they're planning. (Applause.) We must ensure that the protections intended for the American people are not extended to terrorists overseas who are plotting to harm us. And we must grant liability protection to companies who are facing multibillion-dollar lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend our nation following the 9/11 attacks. The Senate Intel Committee has approved a bipartisan bill that contains provisions to preserve our ability to collect intelligence on terrorists overseas, while protecting the civil liberties of Americans here at home. This bill still needs some improving, but it's an important step in the right direction. (Applause.) Time is of the essence, and the full Senate and the House of Representatives need to pass a good bill and get it to my desk promptly so our intelligence professionals can continue to use the vital tools of the Protect America Act to keep us safe. (Applause.) Congress is also stalling on the emergency war supplemental to fund our troops on the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq. This crucial bill includes funds for bullets and body armor, protection against IEDs and mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. Congress should be able to move the supplemental quickly. There's no reason why they're not moving the supplemental -- after all, it had more than eight months to study most of its provisions. In fact, nearly 75 percent of the funding request in the supplemental was submitted along with my annual budget in February of this year. The supplemental is critical for our troops -- and Congress should not go home for the holidays while our men and women in uniform are waiting for the funds they need. (Applause.) Congress also needs to pass the Department of Defense spending bill, as well as the funding bill for our nation's veterans. There are reports that congressional leaders may be considering combining the funding bills for our military and our veterans together with a bloated labor, health and education spending bill. It's hard to imagine a more cynical ploy than holding funding for our troops and our wounded warriors hostage in order to extract $11 billion in wasteful Washington spending. If the reports of this strategy are true, I will veto such a three-bill pileup. (Applause.) I ask Congress to send me a clean veterans funding bill by Veterans Day; and to pass a clean defense spending bill. Congress needs to put the needs of those who put on the uniform ahead of their desire to spend more money. When it comes to funding our troops, some in Washington should spend more time responding to the warnings of terrorists like Osama bin Laden and the requests of our commanders on the ground, and less time responding to the demands of MoveOn.org bloggers and Code Pink protesters. (Applause.) Here's the bottom line: This is no time for Congress to weaken the Department of Justice by denying it a strong and effective leader. It's no time for Congress to weaken our ability to gather vital intelligence from captured terrorists. It's no time for Congress to weaken our ability to intercept information from terrorists about potential attacks on the United States of America. And this is no time for Congress to hold back vital funding for our troops as they fight al Qaeda terrorists and radicals in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the struggle against the terrorists and extremists, I hope I made my strategy clear today -- that we will keep constant pressure on the enemy in order to defend the American people; we will fight them overseas so we do not have to fight them here at home. (Applause.) At the same time, we'll use every available tool of law and intelligence to protect the people here. That's our most solemn duty. It's a duty I think about every day. In the long run, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to advance freedom as the great alternative to radicalism and repression. We can have confidence in this cause because we have seen the power of liberty to transform nations and secure peace before. Here at the Heritage Foundation, you understand this better than most. During the Cold War, there were loud voices in Washington who argued for accommodation of the Soviet Union -- because they believed the watchword of our policy should be ""stability."" At Heritage, you knew that when it came to the Soviet Union, the watchword of our policy should be ""freedom."" Together with a great President named Ronald Reagan, you championed a policy of rolling back communism oppression and bringing freedom to nations enslaved by communist tyranny. And by taking the side of dissidents, who [sic] helped millions across the world throw off the shackles of communism, you helped build the free and peaceful societies that are the true sources of stability and peace in the world. And now we're at the start of a new century, and the same debate is once again unfolding -- this time regarding my policy in the Middle East. Once again, voices in Washington are arguing that the watchword of the policy should be ""stability."" And once again they're wrong. In Kabul, in Baghdad, in Beirut, and other cities across the broader Middle East, brave men and women are risking their lives every day for the same freedoms we enjoy. And like the citizens of Prague and Warsaw and Budapest in the century gone by, they are looking to the United States to stand up for them, speak out for them, and champion their cause. And we are doing just that. (Applause.) We are standing with those who yearn for the liberty -- who yearn for liberty in the Middle East, because we understand that the desire for freedom is universal, written by the Almighty into the hearts of every man, woman and child on this Earth. (Applause.) We are standing with those who yearn for liberty in the Middle East, because we know that the terrorists fear freedom even more than they fear our firepower. They know that given a choice, no one will choose to live under their dark ideology of violence and death. We're standing with those who yearn for liberty in the Middle East, because we know that when free societies take root in that part of the world, they will yield the peace we all desire. See, the only way the terrorists can recruit operatives and suicide bombers is by feeding on the hopelessness of societies mired in despair. And by bringing freedom to these societies, we replace hatred with hope, and this will help us to marginalize the extremists and eliminate the conditions that feed radicalism, and make the American people more secure. The lessons of the past have taught us that liberty is transformative. And I believe 50 years from now an American President will be speaking to Heritage and say, thank God that generation that wrote the first chapter in the 21st century understood the power of freedom to bring the peace we want. (Applause.) Thank you for coming. God bless. (Applause.)"
USA_Doc9_Speech_For,"PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you all very much for that warm welcome. It's an honor to be here in Prague, home to so much of Europe's history and culture, and the scene of so much courage in the service of freedom. After the recent floods, I know it's been tough on the citizens of the Czech Republic to not only recover, but to host this important gathering. So, on behalf of all the American delegation and all the Americans who are here, I express our gratitude for the fantastic hospitality we received. We thank the Czech people and their leadership for working hard to make sure this summit is a successful summit, and we wish them all the very best. I want to thank Jimmy for his kind words. Really proud of Jimmy and we're proud to have him at West Point. He's a credit to the Academy, he's a credit to the people of Lithuania. And we wish him all the very best. I want to thank Alan Lee Williams, Antonio Bores Cavallo, for the tremendous work at the Atlantic Treaty Association. I'm grateful to Christopher Makins, who's the President of the Atlantic Council of the United States, for organizing this event. I want to thank Tom Dine, President of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, for joining us. I want to thank all the good folks who work there for joining us, as well. I appreciate your service. Dwight Eisenhower said this of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty -- ""The simplest and clearest charter in the world is what you have, which is to tell the truth."" And for more than 50 years, the charter has been faithfully executed, and it's the truth that sets this continent free. I'm honored to be traveling with members of my senior staff. The Secretary of State of the United States Colin Powell, who's done such a fantastic job for our country and for world peace. Condoleezza Rice, who's my National Security Advisor, is here; Chief of Staff Andy Card; Ambassador Nick Burns to NATO. A few others who I don't particularly want to recognize for fear of damaging my reputation. (Laughter.) But all of them doing a great job. Thank you all for coming. I also want to recognize members of the Congress who are here. I'm thrilled to see members of the Senate. I thought you were voting. (Laughter.) But Senators Frist and Voinovich and their wives are with us. I see Lantos -- yes -- good to see you from California. Who else? That's it. Two members of the House, two members of the Senate. Thank you all for coming. I'm honored you're here. This NATO summit that convenes tomorrow will be the first ever held at the capital of a Warsaw Pact. The days of the Warsaw Pact seem distant -- they must seem to you; after all, the Warsaw Pact ended a half a lifetime ago for you. It was a dark and distant era. The years since have brought great challenge and great hope to all of the countries on this continent. And tomorrow in Prague we will have reached a decisive moment, and historic moment. For, tomorrow, we will invite new members into our alliance. It's a bold decision -- to guarantee the freedom of millions of people. At the summit, we'll make the most significant reforms in NATO since 1949 -- reforms which will allow our Alliance to effectively confront new dangers. And in the years to come, all of the nations of Europe will determine their place in world events. They will take up global responsibilities, or choose to live in isolation from the challenges of our time. As for America, we made our choice. We are committed to work toward world peace, and we're committed to a close and permanent partnership with the nations of Europe. The Atlantic Alliance is America's most important global relationship. We're tied to Europe by history; we are tied to Europe by the wars of liberty we have fought and won together. We're joined by broad ties of trade. And America is bound to Europe by the deepest convictions of our common culture -- our belief in the dignity of every life, and our belief in the power of conscience to move history. And this city and town squares across the Czech Republic are monuments to Jan Hus who said this: ""Stand in the truth you have learned, for it conquers all and is mighty to eternity."" That ideal has given life to the Czech Republic, and it is shared by the republic I lead. America believes that a strong, confident Europe is good for the world. We welcome the economic integration of Europe. We believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. We welcome a democratic Russia as part of this new Europe, because a free and peaceful Europe will add to the security of this continent. We welcome the growing unity of Europe in commerce and currency and military cooperation, which is closing a long history of rivalry and violence. This continent, wounded by Nazism and communism, is becoming peaceful and secure and democratic for the first time. And now that the countries of Europe are united in freedom they will no longer fight each other and bring war to the rest of the world. Because America supports a more united Europe, we strongly support the enlargement of NATO, now and in the future. Every European democracy that seeks NATO membership and is ready to share in NATO's responsibilities should be welcome in our Alliance. The enlargement of NATO is good for all who join us. The standards for membership are high, and they encourage the hard work of political and economic and military reform. And nations in the family of NATO, old or new, know this: Anyone who would choose you for an enemy also chooses us for an enemy. Never again in the face of aggression will you stand alone. A larger NATO is good for Russia, as well. Later this week I will visit St. Petersburg. I will tell my friend, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian people that they, too, will gain from the security and stability of nations to Russia's west. Russia does not require a buffer zone of protection; it needs peaceful and prosperous neighbors who are also friends. We need a strong and democratic Russia as our friend and partner to face the next century's new challenges. Through the NATO-Russia Council we must increase our cooperation with Russia for the security of all of us. Expansion of NATO also brings many advantages to the Alliance, itself. Every new member contributes military capabilities that add to our common security. We see this already in Afghanistan -- for forces from Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and others have joined with 16 NATO allies to help defeat global terror. And every new member of our Alliance makes a contribution of character. Tomorrow, NATO grows larger. Tomorrow, the soul of Europe grows stronger. Members recently added to NATO and those invited to join bring greater clarity to purposes of our Alliance, because they understand the lessons of the last century. Those with fresh memories of tyranny know the value of freedom. Those who have lived through a struggle of good against evil are never neutral between them. Czechs and Slovaks learned through the harsh experience of 1938, that when great democracies fail to confront danger, greater dangers follow. And the people of the Baltics learned that aggression left unchecked by the great democracies can rob millions of their liberty and their lives. In Central and Eastern Europe the courage and moral vision of prisoners and exiles and priests and playwrights caused tyrants to fall. The spirit now sustains these nations through difficult reforms. And this spirit is needed in the councils of a new Europe. Our NATO Alliance faces dangers very different from those it was formed to confront. Yet, never has our need for collective defense been more urgent. The Soviet Union is gone, but freedom still has enemies. We're threatened by terrorism, bred within failed states, it's present within our own cities. We're threatened by the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons which are produced by outlaw regimes and could be delivered either by missile or terrorist cell. For terrorists and terrorist states, every free nation -- every free nation -- is a potential target, including the free nations of Europe. We're making progress on this, the first war of the 21st century. Today more than 90 nations are joined in a global coalition to defeat terror. We're sharing intelligence. We're freezing the assets of terror groups. We're pursuing the terrorists wherever they plot and train. And we're finding them and bringing them to justice, one person at a time. Today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by Iraq. A dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons. We will not permit Saddam Hussein to blackmail and/or terrorize nations which love freedom. Last week Saddam Hussein accepted U.N. inspectors. We've heard those pledges before and seen them violated time and time again. We now call an end to that game of deception and deceit and denial. Saddam Hussein has been given a very short time to declare completely and truthfully his arsenal of terror. Should he again deny that this arsenal exists, he will have entered his final stage with a lie. And deception this time will not be tolerated. Delay and defiance will invite the severest of consequences. America's goal, the world's goal is more than the return of inspectors to Iraq. Our goal is to secure the peace through the comprehensive and verified disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Voluntary, or by force, that goal will be achieved. To meet all of this century's emerging threats from terror camps in remote regions to hidden laboratories of outlaw regimes, NATO must develop new military capabilities. NATO forces must become better able to fight side by side. Those forces must be more mobile and more swiftly deployed. The allies need more special operations forces, better precision strike capabilities, and more modern command structures. Few NATO members will have state-of-the-art capabilities in all of these areas; I recognize that. But every nation should develop some. Ours is a military alliance, and every member must make a military contribution to that alliance. For some allies, this will require higher defense spending. For all of us, it will require more effective defense spending, with each nation adding the tools and technologies to fight and win a new kind of war. And because many threats to the NATO members come from outside of Europe, NATO forces must be organized to operate outside of Europe. When forces were needed quickly in Afghanistan, NATO's options were limited. We must build new capabilities and we must strengthen our will to use those capabilities. The United States proposes the creation of a NATO response force that will bring together well-equipped, highly ready air, ground and sea forces from NATO allies -- old and new. This force will be prepared to deploy on short notice wherever it is needed. A NATO response force will take time to create and we should begin that effort here in Prague. Yet, security against new threats requires more than just new capabilities. Free nations must accept our shared obligations to keep the peace. The world needs the nations of this continent to be active in the defense of freedom; not inward-looking or isolated by indifference. Ignoring dangers or excusing aggression may temporarily avert conflict, but they don't bring true peace. International stability must be actively defended, and all nations that benefit from that stability have a duty to help. In this noble work, America and the strong democracies of Europe need each other, each playing our full and responsible role. The good we can do together is far greater than the good we can do apart. Great evil is stirring in the world. Many of the young here are coming up in a different world, different era, a different time, a different series of threats. We face perils we've never thought about, perils we've never seen before. But they're dangerous. They're just as dangerous as those perils that your fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers faced. The hopes of all mankind depend on the courage and the unity of great democracies. In this hour of challenge, NATO will do what it has done before: We will stand firm against the enemies of freedom, and we'll prevail. The transatlantic ties of Europe and America have met every test of history, and we intend to again. U-boats could not divide us. The threats and stand-offs of the Cold War did not make us weary. The commitment of my nation to Europe is found in the carefully tended graves of young Americans who died for this continent's freedom. That commitment is shown by the thousands in uniforms still serving here, from the Balkans to Bavaria, still willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for this continent's future. For a hundred years place names of Europe have often stood for conflict and tragedy and loss. Single words evoke sad and bitter experience -- Verdun, Munich, Stalingrad, Dresden, Nuremberg and Yalta. We have no power to rewrite history. We do have the power to write a different story for our time. When future generations look back at this moment and speak of Prague and what we did here, that name will stand for hope. In Prague, young democracies will gain new security; a grand Alliance will gather a strength and find new purpose. And America and Europe will renew the historic friendship that still keeps the peace of the world. Thank you for your interest. May God bless you all. (Applause.)"
